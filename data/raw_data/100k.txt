Why , you 're up , dear ?
Yes .
I 'm surprised myself .
I might as well lie in bed all day .
I have nothing to get up for .
Well , what a charming reception .
I spend all morning reviewing the household guards , distributing medals ... and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister ...
I steal away to have a look at my husband , and-and -
He doesn 't even say good morning to me .
Good morning .
Well , that finishes my morning 's work .
What can I do now ?
I have already shaved .
I had my hair cut yesterday .
There 's nothing left .
So , you 're bored .
All I 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me I 'm neglecting you .
Do you realize that not once since we 've been married ... have I left you alone at night ?
And I never will .
Thank you .
It 's very kind of you .
And after this foreign loan is arranged ...
I 'm going to take you to Vienna ... and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms .
That 's it .
You think all you have to do is to buy me a few new uniforms ... and I 'll be satisfied .
That 's the opinion you have of me , is it ?
Oh , don 't be silly , Alfred .
Oh , I 'm sick of being treated as if I were a sort of plaything .
- You 're in a horrible mood today .
- Am I ?
- You have a cold ?
- No .
Why do you cough ?
Listen , Louise .
You have the power to exclude me from all military affairs ... from all cabinet meetings .
But , please , do not interfere with my coughing .
I cough when I want to .
At last , I 've found something to do .
I will repair this today .
Yes .
Immediately after -
I almost forgot something very important .
Alfred , where are you going ?
Something very important .
I am going to have breakfast .
Where is my breakfast ?
May I remind Your Highness ... that Her Majesty the queen has not as yet appeared .
- Well .
And ?
- Well , I 'm sure Your Highness knows ... that breakfast cannot be served before the appearance of Her Majesty .
I want my breakfast .
Your Highness , I am very sorry .
- We must wait .
- I can 't wait .
I want my breakfast .
I 'm hungry .
Your Highness , I regret it , but it 's impossible to -
Her Majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning .
Breakfast for His Highness .
Please , Your Highness .
- Do you speak French ?
- No , Your Highness .
You 're the only one in the palace who looks up to me .
# Just look at me #
# I think my heart will break #
# Nobody seems to take me seriously #
# Honestly #
# I 'm just as lonely as a man can be #
# The days mean nothing at all #
# And when the shadows fall #
# The moon is only wasting time on me #
# Candidly #
# There must be something awful wrong #
# With me #
# I have a pair of hands #
# To hug and hold #
# But nobody 's using them now #
# I 've loads of love #
# That could be told #
# But nobody 's using them now #
# I 've a world of time #
# That 's all my own #
# They say that you go silly if you spend it alone #
# I 'm telling the truth I 'm just wasting my youth #
# ' Cause nobody 's using it now No , no , no , no #
# Nobody 's using it now #
# There 's a bridal suite #
# In gold and blue #
# But nobody 's using it now #
# I 've learned to wear pajamas too #
# What 's the use of wearing them now #
# I 've sown wild oats #
# I have indeed #
# But now that I 've stopped sowing them I 'm going to seed #
# For years and for years I 've had great ideas #
# But nobody 's using them now No , no , no , no #
# Nobody 's using them now #
# I have a big settee with patent springs #
# I 've some pleasing ways and - other things #
# I 'm a family man who 's out of sorts #
# I 'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts #
# I blush to admit I 've still plenty of " it " #
# But nobody 's using it now No , no , no , no #
# Nobody 's using it now Zum , zum # #
... try to see the prince .
Isn 't there standing room ?
Oh , but I must see the prince .
Oh ?
Oh .
Oh , is that so ?
Mm-hmm .
All right .
The moment it was announced that Your Majesty ... would attend the opening of the opera in person ... the place was completely sold out .
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country .
- Yes , indeed , Your Majesty .
Have the spotlights been focused on the entrance to the opera house ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
Twelve motion picture cameras will photograph the arrival ... of Your Majesty and the prince consort .
The crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm ... that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police .
And has all this been well rehearsed ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
The crowd is the same one that we used at Your Majesty 's wedding .
They all know their parts perfectly .
Good .
Go on .
When Your Majesty and the prince consort appear in the royal box ... the whole audience will rise .
For two minutes , we will have silent homage .
Your Majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles .
You are both in the best of humor .
- In the best of humor ?
- Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
And does the prince consort know he 's to be in the best of humor ?
Well - Your Majesty , I-I -
- Well , you 'd better tell him , to be safe .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Your Majesty frightens us .
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing your matrimonial happiness to the public .
- And if the prince consort does not smile in joy -
- It will mean disaster .
The diplomatic representatives of the whole world will be guests in the royal box .
And unfortunately , the Afghan ambassador too .
And if he sees any coolness between you , he 'll report it to Afghanistan .
Well , let him .
But surely Your Majesty knows that if Afghanistan hears anything ...
Baluchistan hears it too .
And if Baluchistan hears it , then all Persia will know it .
And what is talked of in Persia spreads all over Turkey .
And when anything is known in Turkey , the Armenians get onto it immediately .
And you know how many Armenians go to America .
So if Wall Street hears of a rift in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty ... it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan .
- And without that loan , we are broke .
- Broke !
So , unless I have a smile on my face tonight , we are broke .
- Yes , Your Highness .
- And you call yourselves statesmen .
Borrowing money is all that you 're able to do .
Prince Alfred , what are you permitting yourself ?
I permit myself to make the following suggestion .
We do not need a loan .
We have enough natural resources .
There is my plan for the national budget .
I have worked out everything - in my sleepless days .
The country can be saved without a loan .
Go on .
Read it .
It includes everything .
Even your dressmakers ' bills .
I am not permitted to receive suggestions in the affairs of state ... from the prince consort .
Not even when they are good ?
Not even then .
- Do you speak French ?
- Yes , Your Highness .
Too bad .
Prince Alfred , I must ask you once and for all ... not to interfere in affairs of state .
I know .
I 'm Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Prince Alfred , you may leave the room .
Stay , gentlemen .
Prince Alfred , you will meet me here at 7 : 00 ... in full gala uniform - all medals and decorations - and in the very best of humor .
And in case I don 't feel like complying with Your Majesty 's wish ?
This is not my wish .
It is my command .
If Your Majesty had not already commanded me to smile ...
I would laugh .
# When they went riding yesterday they never spoke a word #
- # You don 't say # - # Is it true #
- # Think of that # - # Who 's to blame #
# And he asked for garlic in his soup at dinner , so I heard #
- Something 's wrong
- Did you hear
- Are you sure
- What a shame
# I know the queen regrets it but of course the man 's to blame #
- # Good for you # - # Not at all #

You can tell him my patience is exhausted .
If he won 't come here voluntarily , I 'll have him brought here ... even if I have to send soldiers .
Yes , Your Majesty .
His Highness , the prince consort .
Why are you dressed like this ?
What does it mean ?
It means I 'm dressed for traveling .
I 'm going to Paris .
You go change at once .
You 're going to the opera with me .
Only with soldiers and handcuffed .
Alfred , you know very well how much depends on this - my name , my position , my reputation as queen .
If you fail me tonight , all will be over between us .
It is already over - and forever .
- Alfred .
- You have gone too far , madame .
You thought you could order the former military attaché around and command the husband .
But you forgot one thing , madame - that first , I am a man .
- I know that , Alfred .
- No , you do not .
But I 'm going to prove it to you .
Good-bye , madame .
- You mean you 're really going ?
- Yes .
Oh , but , Alfred , won 't you love me anymore ?
Only with soldiers and handcuffed .
Alfred !
Alfred !

I beg you to stay .
Since you beg me so lovingly ...
I 'll be generous .
I 'll stay .
You want to humiliate me .
That 's why you came here .
No .
I came because -
Why ?
Because , after all ...
I didn 't want to ruin the woman I once loved .
But tomorrow , I 'm leaving for Paris .
And as soon as this loan of yours is signed ...
I will file papers for divorce .
If you don 't treat me nicely , I 'll go right home .
All right .
Go on .
Still here ?
If you don 't take those glasses from your eyes , I 'll tear them away .
Go on .
You can 't do it , eh ?
You 're a queen .
You must behave .
If you were just a mere woman , you could make a scandal .
But you can 't .
That 's what you get for being a queen .
Huh ?
Ah , yes .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Oh !
He 'll never get these glasses back .

She is in her room , and he is in his .
Yes .
Sad , isn 't it ?
When we get married , let 's be common ... and only have one room between us .
Why even one room between us ?
Who is it ?
Louise .
What do you want ?
A mouse is in my room .
Call your soldiers .
What are you doing ?
Packing .
- Can I help you ?
- No , thanks .
- -
Please .
The key , please .
So , you 're trying to use force again , madame ?
Where shall we live in Paris ?
- We ?
- Yes .
I 'm going with you .
Wherever you go , I 'll follow you .
You can 't get rid of me .
Well , there is no use for me to leave then .
No .
No use at all .
I suppose I might as well stay here .
I suppose so too .
But how am I going to punish you ?
- And you must be punished .
- Yes .
- And severely .
- Yes .
But how ?
Let me see .
An awful punishment .
Let me see .
It 's really not so easy .
May I
- May I make a suggestion ?
Yes .
Sit down .
If I were in your place , I 'd say :
" Louise , I don 't want a divorce .
- I love you too much for that . "
- No , no , no , no , no .
But I 'd say : " Louise ...
" you can 't order me around any longer .
" From now on , I shall take command -
" not only of the affairs of state ...
" not only in the Department of the Navy ... but also here at home . "
And my first command would be ...
" Louise , don 't dare to leave this room .
" You shall stay here ...
" at my side ... attached to me from morning till , uh " -
" from night till morning . "
And you call that a punishment ?
Yes ... my king .

Count Renard , this scandal will be your last .
At any rate , your last in Paris .
As the ambassador of Sylvania ...
I cannot any longer permit our military attaché ... to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless escapades .
Your Excellency , please -
But that is an end .
You will leave at once for Sylvania and report to Her Majesty the queen in person .
But , Your Excellency , I 'm sure the stories you 've heard about me are horribly - are horribly exaggerated .
Count Renard ... for one week , I made it my business to follow you about personally .
Oh .
I 'm sorry I didn 't know it , Your Excellency .
I would have taken you to some real places .
How dare you .
I know more about you than you think .
My wife has told me everything .
You are to take the first train .
I think I had better take the first airplane .
You are going by plane , monsieur ?
Yes , Jacques .
And I 've got to leave you .
You 're not going to take me with you ?
- I 'm sorry .
- But what will you do without me ?
Think how good I am at making up excuses for you .
Why , I can even imitate your voice on the telephone ... and pretend you 're at home to one lady ... when you 're really having supper with another .
Yes , Jacques .
You 're a very good servant .
And you can tell lies better than anybody I know .
But I won 't need you anymore .
In fact , I will probably be sent to a military prison .
But even so , you 'll need me , monsieur .
Supposing someone you don 't want to see calls at the prison .
Who 's going to tell them you 're not at home ?
I can 't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful Paris .
But , monsieur , I am a Frenchman .
And to be a Frenchman in Paris is nothing ... because everyone in Paris is a Frenchman .
- That 's true .
- But to be a Frenchman in -
- What is the name of your country ?
- Sylvania .
That is different .
Why , even my stories will be new there .
I can actually tell them the one about the Frenchman and the farmer 's daughter .
Oh , please , monsieur , take me to Pennsylvania .
- Sylvania .
- Take me to Sylvania .
All right , Jacques .
I 'll take you there .
Go and pack the bags .
Oh , thank you .
Thank you , monsieur .
I am so happy .
( Barks )
I am not .
# You 'll never miss me when I 'm gone Paris #

Ladies and gentlemen , on your right you see the Royal Opera House .
And on my left , the residence of Her Majesty , Queen Louise I of Sylvania .
The construction of the castle was begun under Maximilian I in 1537 ... and finished in 1687 under Maximilian VIII .
The castle contains one of the most beautiful picture galleries in the world ... and its collection of art treasures is unsurpassed .
The castle represents a value of $ 110 million .
- ( All Murmuring ) - ( Man ) $ 110 million ?
- ( Chattering ) - 110 !

Good morning , Your Majesty .
( Women ) Good morning , Your Majesty .
I 'm so hopeful Your Majesty rested well .
Why am I always awakened from my dreams ?
I 'm sure it was a nice dream , Your Majesty .
Oh , it was wonderful .
It was gorgeous .
Mmm .
Oh .
Mmm .
I hope Your Majesty 's dream comes true .
No .
I 'm afraid it will always have to remain ... a dream .
# There 's a land of charm that I know #
# Land of sweet romance where I love to go #
# And its bounds touch my room #
# In the gloom where the shadows creep #
# Someone I meet there waits for me #
# Someone tender as a lover should be #
# And I whisper each night #
# As I close my eyes #
# In sleep #
# Dream lover #
# Fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# I 'm held #
# In your spell #
# Knowing so well #
# Dreams never tell #
# We two can leave the world behind us #
# Nobody indiscreet can find us #
# Oh , dream lover mine #

- # Nobody indiscreet can find us # - # Nobody indiscreet can find us , I know #
# Dream lover #
- # # - # Secrets divine #
- # # - # I will share them #
# With you # #
Please , Your Majesty .
Won 't you tell us more about your dream ?
I 'm afraid I can 't .
It wasn 't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen .
Was it the sort of dream for a lady-in-waiting ?
I hope not .
I had a lovely dream myself - about Your Majesty .
I dreamed that Your Majesty got married .
And you call that a lovely dream ?
Why not , Your Majesty ?
We all wish , we all hope , we all pray ...
- that very soon Your Majesty will be -
- Married .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Marriage .
Marriage .
In all my country , nothing else is ever spoken of .
What do the children learn at school ?
" The queen is unmarried still . "
What do the papers write about ?
" Is the queen to marry ? "
What does my Parliament debate ?
" When shall the queen marry ? "
And from my ministers :
" Whom shall the queen marry ? "
Marriage .
Marriage .
That 's all I hear , morning or night .
# # ( " Wedding March " )
Didn 't I tell that conductor never to play the " Wedding March " again ?
But , Your Majesty , it is not the same conductor .
- This is a new one .
- Where 's the old one ?
He is being married today .
Oh .
Oh .
Phew !
( Continues )
- ( Ends ) - ( Trumpet Fanfare )
- Good morning , gentlemen .
- Good morning , Your Majesty .
Well ?
Whom can you suggest today ?
For what , Your Majesty ?
For my husband .
Now don 't tell me you weren 't talking about it .
You 're always talking about it .
We have no one to suggest , Your Majesty .
We have given the matter up .
- Really ?
- ( Ministers ) Yes , Your Majesty .
Oh , what a relief .
( Chuckles )
Oh , how glad I am .
( Chuckles )
And , uh ... why have you given the matter up , may I ask ?
- Well , uh - - ( All Clearing Throats )
- You see , it 's rather difficult .
- ( Ministers ) Very difficult .
Difficult ?
You tell me it 's difficult to find a husband for me ?
( Ministers ) Yes , Your Majesty .
Excuse me , Baron .
How does Her Majesty feel today ?
( Louise ) And that 's final , Admiral .
I certainly don 't need any help from the navy .
Yes , Your Majesty .
But surely Your Majesty must realize that the field for selection is limited .
If marrying you were to make a man a king ... that would be different .
But Your Majesty 's husband would be simply prince consort .
After all , what is a prince consort ?
He is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights .
- He has nothing to say , nothing to do .
- Well , I wouldn 't say that .
( Whispering )
Of course , he has something to do , naturally .
And yet , uh , he has nothing to do , if you see what I mean .
I see .
He is Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Nothing else ?
- But isn 't it enough to be my husband ?
- But , Your Majesty -
It never seems to occur to you gentlemen that there might possibly be some men ... who would enjoy being my husband even if I were not a queen .
My face isn 't actually painful to look at .
My complexion 's quite good .
And in case you 're too serious-minded to notice such things ... let me inform you ... my legs are perfect .
There 's only one other leg like that in the whole of Sylvania .
And that 's it .
Do you see ?
Thank you .
I didn 't see , Your Majesty .
( Whispering ) How do you think I should behave ?
Should I be humble , proud , apologetic ?
Say as little as possible .
I don 't think your French accent will please Her Majesty .
( Strong French Accent ) Is it still very notice-able ?
No .
It 's very noticeable .
( French Pronunciation ) Oh .
But that 's terrible .
No .
It 's terrible .
How did you acquire this accent ?
( Chuckles ) I 'll tell you .
Once , in Paris , I had an awful cold .
I went to see a great French doctor to cure it .
I rang the bell .
The door was opened by a lady .
- Mm-hmm .
- A beautiful lady .
Mm-hmm .
The doctor 's wife .
( No Audible Dialogue )
And in less than a month ...
I had lost my cold ... but I had a terrific French accent .
( Louise ) And if I 'm talked to like this again , I 'll dissolve the cabinet .
- ( Minister ) Yes , Your Majesty .
- I 'll dismiss the whole general staff .
- ( Minister # 2 ) Yes , Your Majesty .
- And if that band ... plays the " Wedding March " once more ...
- I 'll give orders to shoot !
- ( Ministers ) Yes , Your Majesty .
I 'm sorry , Count .
You 're next .
- What do you want ?
- Count Alfred Renard ...
Your Majesty 's military attaché at Your Majesty 's embassy in Paris .
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty .
- You 'll have to wait .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- What do you want ?
- Count Alfred Renard ...
Your Majesty 's military attaché at Your Majesty 's embassy in Paris .
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty .
- Didn 't I tell you to wait ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Then wait .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Count .
Count Alfred , I understand you 've been seriously involved ... in a disgraceful affair with a woman .
No , Your Majesty .
With several .
Aren 't you ashamed of yourself ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
( Both Chuckling )
I don 't think it 's funny .
I think it 's serious .
Very serious .
- And I shall have to punish you .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- I shall have to punish you very severely .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Otherwise you 'd start all over again .
( Chuckles ) Yes !
I shall think of a punishment that will cure you forever .
An awful punishment .
Let me see .
An awful punishment .
You shall be ordered ... to grow a beard .
- A beard , Your Majesty ?
- Yes .
That will stop all your philandering .
You 'll have to be serious in a beard .
And am I to be permitted to attend Your Majesty after the beard is grown ?
Certainly .
I shall want to see that my instructions have been obeyed .
Then I fear Your Majesty will regret the order .
I look terrible in a beard .
- Really ?
- Oh , dreadful .
( Chuckles ) Of course , there are men who look fine in beards , like sheiks .
- Well , yes .
That 's what I thought .
- But I don 't .
- No ?
- Oh !
Oh , I grew one once to see .
Ah , it came out all red and scraggly .
Oh , no .
No , I assure Your Majesty ... it would be the most awful-looking beard in Sylvania .
And - ( Chuckles ) That 's saying a great deal .
- Well , then don 't grow it .
- No , Your Majesty .
- Don 't do it .
- No , no , Your Majesty .
- No beard .
- No , no , Your Majesty .
- You promise me .
- My word of honor .
But what can I do with you ?
I 've got to punish you .
May I make a suggestion ?
You want to suggest a punishment for yourself ?
Yes .
Of course .
Please .
Well , tell me .
If I were in Your Majesty 's place ...
I would say this :
" Count Alfred ...
" the sort of life you 've been leading must stop .
You shall not return to Paris . "
Very good .
Then I would say :
- " Alfred " -
- Hmm ?
" Count Alfred , you shall stay here ...
" in the palace ...
" attached to me .
And from morning till night , never dare to leave my side . "
And you call that a punishment ?
- ( Chuckles )
- You 're the most impudent man I 've ever met .
You seem to forget you 're talking to your queen .
( Rings )
Count Alfred will dine with me tonight .
At 8 : 00 ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
- White uniform .
- ( Chuckles )
Yes , Your Majesty .
You understand ?
Oh , yes , I understand .
# With such a bad report of you I wonder what I ought to do with you #
# You really can 't be too severe when my regret is so sincere #

# Everything to please the queen #
# Morning , noon and night #
# I 'm yours to command me #
# You want me good Then I 'll be good #
# You want me bad Then I 'll be bad #
# I mean , I could be both #

# I 've had no complaints so far #
- # You mean # - # Anything to please the queen #
# Anything to please the queen # #
Perhaps you didn 't quite follow me , Count .
You 're invited for dinner , not for tea .
I followed Your Majesty perfectly .
Hmm .
Too perfectly , I 'm afraid .
Remember . 8 : 00 .
8 : 00 .
Oh , Count .
Don 't forget .
No beard .
Oh , no , Your Majesty .
# Anything to please the queen Everything to please the queen #
# Morning , noon and night I 'm yours to command # #

( Tolling Continues )
( Jacques ) Just a minute , monsieur .
In case some lady should telephone , am I to say you have a date with the queen ?
- No lady will telephone .
- But if ?
Impossible .
There is no telephone .
( Laughs )
Do you know the story of the Frenchman and the farmer 's daughter ?
I know it .
I am the Frenchman .
You are not .
How do you know ?
I am the farmer 's daughter .
Go home .
Are you talking to me or to the dog ?
- Is this your animal ?
- Yes .
Then take it away .
Don 't you see it is eating out of the same dish as the queen 's dog ?
Listen here .
If my master 's good enough to have dinner with the queen ... then his dog can eat dinner with the queen 's dog .
- So , that 's your master .
- Yes .
- That naughty boy from Paris ?
- Yes .
Do you know why the queen has invited him for dinner ?
Because the king 's away .
There is no king .
- She hasn 't got a husband ?
- No .
Oh .
Now I know why she invited him .
( Whispered Chattering )
But , gentlemen , even if she liked him , would he be eligible to become the prince consort ?
Why , absolutely .
His great grandfather was the illegitimate son of one king ... and his grandmother the sweetheart of another .
- Oh .
- ( All Murmuring )
I had no idea that he came from such a distinguished family .
And do you think Her Majesty is serious ?
Why , how can you doubt it ?
The first time she sees him , she invites him to dine with her alone .
- And if it goes on at this rate -
- Then we 're entitled to the highest hopes .
- ( Chattering )
- Shh !
They 're coming .
They sit down .
They are seated .
She smiles at him .
He smiles at her .
They both smile ... at each other !
At each other ?
( Murmuring )
- She is laughing .
- That 's the way they always start .
And how she laughs .
He must have told her the story of the Frenchman and the farmer -
The lackey is bringing in champagne .
- Now they are clinking glasses .
- ( Murmuring )
- She drinks his health .
- ( Murmuring )
He drinks hers .
He tells her , " This is the most beautiful moment of my life . "
How do you know that he does ?
You can 't hear anything .
- What else could he say ?
- ( Chattering )
They 've opened the window .
What does it mean ?
- The queen is warm .
- The champagne .
No .
It 's him .
She 's going to her boudoir .
She opens the door .
( Whispering )
- She enters the boudoir .
- Heavens !
She beckons to him .
He enters .
( Chattering Excitedly )
She closes the door behind them !
Heaven save the queen !
You know , Count ... this is the first time I 've ever dined with a man alone .
And this is the first time I have ever -
Don 't lie .
The first time I ever dined with a queen .
But with women ?
( Chuckles )
Of course .
( Chuckles )
Of course I have dined with women .
These dinners in Paris ... were charming ?
Yes .
( Chuckles )
The food in Paris is very , very good .
And the ladies ?
Oh - ( Chuckles Nervously , Mumbles )
Well , I feel , by comparison ... it must be very dull ... dining with a queen .
It would be the most delightful experience of my life ... dining with a queen , if lf ?
- If one ... could forget -
That I am a queen .
Yes .
Very well .
Forget it .
I am no longer Queen Louise I of Sylvania ... but a woman .
A mere woman .
And you 're meeting me for the first time .
What would you do ?
Oh .
( Chuckles )
What would you do ?
Hello , Louise .
( Chuckles )
All this the first time you meet ?
Yes .
Oh .
Oh , but if it 's like this at first ... what can be left for later ?
Plenty .
If she appeals to you ... and if you find out that you love her ... oh , there 's plenty left ...
- if she were like -
- Like ?
If she were like -

By personal order extraordinary ...
Your Majesty has bestowed upon Count Alfred the title of prince ... and by this merciful act has uplifted him to a station ... where marriage between you is possible .
Is it still Your Majesty 's wish ... to select Prince Alfred as Your Majesty 's husband ?
It is .
Is Your Majesty willing to be a loving wife to the prince consort ?
I am .
And will Your Majesty protect him from all danger ?
I will .
And you , Prince Alfred ... you abide by Her Majesty 's selection ... and are happy to accept the station of prince consort ?
Yes .
You promise always to love Her Majesty ?
Yes , I do .
You promise further to fulfill Her Majesty 's every wish ... to execute Her Majesty 's every command ... and to be an obedient and docile husband ?
( Whispered Chattering )
- He hesitates .
- Incredible .
- He hesitates at promising to obey .
- And to be docile .
He should 've thought of that before .
Yes , I do .
( Organ , Soft )
I pronounce you wife ... and man .
( Speaking Foreign Language )
What does he say ?
He says , " Man is man , and woman is woman .
And that to change that causes trouble . "
He does not see how any man could stand being a wife .
And therefore he hopes this will be a most unhappy marriage .
For heaven 's sake .
If he reports this to Afghanistan -
Tell him this is a love match ... and will be the happiest marriage in the world .

But there 's no chance of their marriage going wrong .
Why , it even started wrong .
What does that lady think she 's marrying - a trained poodle ?
She is not a lady .
She is a queen .
Well , he 's not a king .
He 's a gentleman .
But when royalty marry , they don 't quarrel like common people do .
They can 't afford to .
That 's just the trouble .
They can 't let off steam with a good old row like you or I.
That 's true .
But we common people can take life easy .
We can act natural , and nobody will care .
We can eat chicken with our fingers .
Look at the names I can call you .
Look at the things I can throw at you .
Oh , it 's wonderful being common .

Don 't do it again !
Ladies and gentlemen ... four weeks ago today , our illustrious queen was married .
The desire of her subjects to celebrate this date ... is readily understood .
But in consideration of the royal honeymoon ...
I must ask the public to refrain just a little longer ... from any serenades , torchlight processions ... or public demonstrations of any kind and , in particular ... to patriotically observe quiet within the limits of the castle ... especially in the early morning hours .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you .

Why , you 're up , dear ?
Yes .
I 'm surprised myself .
I might as well lie in bed all day .
I have nothing to get up for .
Well , what a charming reception .
I spend all morning reviewing the household guards , distributing medals ... and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister ...
I steal away to have a look at my husband , and-and -
He doesn 't even say good morning to me .
Good morning .
Well , that finishes my morning 's work .
What can I do now ?
I have already shaved .
I had my hair cut yesterday .
There 's nothing left .
So , you 're bored .
All I 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me I 'm neglecting you .
Do you realize that not once since we 've been married ... have I left you alone at night ?
And I never will .
Thank you .
It 's very kind of you .
And after this foreign loan is arranged ...
I 'm going to take you to Vienna ... and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms .
That 's it .
You think all you have to do is to buy me a few new uniforms ... and I 'll be satisfied .
That 's the opinion you have of me , is it ?
Oh , don 't be silly , Alfred .
Oh , I 'm sick of being treated as if I were a sort of plaything .

I am going to have breakfast .

May I remind Your Highness ... that Her Majesty the queen has not as yet appeared .
- Well .

I want my breakfast .

( Woman ) ... try to see the prince .
Isn 't there standing room ?
Oh , but I must see the prince .
( Chattering Continues )
Oh ?
Oh .
Oh , is that so ?
Mm-hmm .
All right .
The moment it was announced that Your Majesty ... would attend the opening of the opera in person ... the place was completely sold out .
( Ministers Chattering )
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country .
- ( Minister ) Yes , indeed , Your Majesty .
Have the spotlights been focused on the entrance to the opera house ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
Twelve motion picture cameras will photograph the arrival ... of Your Majesty and the prince consort .
The crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm ... that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police .
And has all this been well rehearsed ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
The crowd is the same one that we used at Your Majesty 's wedding .
They all know their parts perfectly .
Good .
Go on .
When Your Majesty and the prince consort appear in the royal box ... the whole audience will rise .
For two minutes , we will have silent homage .
Your Majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles .
You are both in the best of humor .
- In the best of humor ?
- Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
And does the prince consort know he 's to be in the best of humor ?
Well - ( Coughs ) Your Majesty , I-I -
- Well , you 'd better tell him , to be safe .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Your Majesty frightens us .
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing your matrimonial happiness to the public .
- And if the prince consort does not smile in joy -
- It will mean disaster .
The diplomatic representatives of the whole world will be guests in the royal box .
And unfortunately , the Afghan ambassador too .
And if he sees any coolness between you , he 'll report it to Afghanistan .
Well , let him .
But surely Your Majesty knows that if Afghanistan hears anything ...
Baluchistan hears it too .
And if Baluchistan hears it , then all Persia will know it .
And what is talked of in Persia spreads all over Turkey .
And when anything is known in Turkey , the Armenians get onto it immediately .
And you know how many Armenians go to America .
So if Wall Street hears of a rift in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty ... it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan .
- And without that loan , we are broke .
- ( Ministers ) Broke !
( Door Slams )
So , unless I have a smile on my face tonight , we are broke .
- ( Ministers ) Yes , Your Highness .
- And you call yourselves statesmen .
Borrowing money is all that you 're able to do .
Prince Alfred , what are you permitting yourself ?
I permit myself to make the following suggestion .
We do not need a loan .
We have enough natural resources .
There is my plan for the national budget .
( Whispered Chattering )
I have worked out everything - in my sleepless days .
The country can be saved without a loan .
Go on .
Read it .
It includes everything .
Even your dressmakers ' bills .
I am not permitted to receive suggestions in the affairs of state ... from the prince consort .
Not even when they are good ?
Not even then .
- Do you speak French ?
- Yes , Your Highness .
Too bad .
Prince Alfred , I must ask you once and for all ... not to interfere in affairs of state .
I know .
I 'm Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Prince Alfred , you may leave the room .
Stay , gentlemen .
Prince Alfred , you will meet me here at 7 : 00 ... in full gala uniform - all medals and decorations - and in the very best of humor .
And in case I don 't feel like complying with Your Majesty 's wish ?
This is not my wish .
It is my command .
If Your Majesty had not already commanded me to smile ...
I would laugh .

Why are you dressed like this ?
What does it mean ?
It means I 'm dressed for traveling .
I 'm going to Paris .
You go change at once .
You 're going to the opera with me .
Only with soldiers and handcuffed .
Alfred , you know very well how much depends on this - my name , my position , my reputation as queen .
If you fail me tonight , all will be over between us .
It is already over - and forever .
- Alfred .
- You have gone too far , madame .
You thought you could order the former military attaché around and command the husband .
But you forgot one thing , madame - that first , I am a man .
- I know that , Alfred .
- No , you do not .
But I 'm going to prove it to you .
Good-bye , madame .
- You mean you 're really going ?
- Yes .
Oh , but , Alfred , won 't you love me anymore ?
Only with soldiers and handcuffed .

Because , after all ...
I didn 't want to ruin the woman I once loved .
But tomorrow , I 'm leaving for Paris .
And as soon as this loan of yours is signed ...
I will file papers for divorce .

Yes ... my king .

Count Renard , this scandal will be your last .
At any rate , your last in Paris .
As the ambassador of Sylvania ...
I cannot any longer permit our military attaché to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless escapades .
Your Excellency , please ...
But that is an end .
You will leave at once for Sylvania and report to Her Majesty the queen in person .
But , Your Excellency , I 'm sure the stories you 've heard about me are horribly ... are horribly exaggerated .
Count Renard ... for one week , I made it my business to follow you about personally .
Oh .
I 'm sorry I didn 't know it , Your Excellency .
I would have taken you to some real places .
How dare you .
I know more about you than you think .
My wife has told me everything .
You are to take the first train .
I think I had better take the first airplane .
You are going by plane , monsieur ?
Yes , Jacques .
And I 've got to leave you .
You 're not going to take me with you ?
- I 'm sorry .
- But what will you do without me ?
Think how good I am at making up excuses for you .
Why , I can even imitate your voice on the telephone ... and pretend you 're at home to one lady ... when you 're really having supper with another .
Yes , Jacques .
You 're a very good servant .
And you can tell lies better than anybody I know .
But I won 't need you anymore .
In fact , I will probably be sent to a military prison .
But even so , you 'll need me , monsieur .
Supposing someone you don 't want to see calls at the prison .
Who 's going to tell them you 're not at home ?
I can 't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful Paris .
But , monsieur , I am a Frenchman .
And to be a Frenchman in Paris is nothing ... because everyone in Paris is a Frenchman .
- That 's true .
- But to be a Frenchman in ...
- What is the name of your country ?
- Sylvania .
That is different .
Why , even my stories will be new there .
I can actually tell them the one about the Frenchman and the farmer 's daughter .
Oh , please , monsieur , take me to Pennsylvania .
- Sylvania .
- Take me to Sylvania .
All right , Jacques .
I 'll take you there .
Go and pack the bags .
Oh , thank you .
Thank you , monsieur .
I am so happy .
I am not .
# You 'll never miss me when I 'm gone Paris #

Ladies and gentlemen , on your right you see the Royal Opera House .
And on my left , the residence of Her Majesty , Queen Louise I of Sylvania .
The construction of the castle was begun under Maximilian I in 1537 ... and finished in 1687 under Maximilian VIII .
The castle contains one of the most beautiful picture galleries in the world ... and its collection of art treasures is unsurpassed .
The castle represents a value of $ 110 million .
$ 110 million ?
110 !
Company ... halt !
You call that a goose step ?
Why , that isn 't a chicken step !
- You blackguards !
- Lieutenant !
Don 't you realize Her Majesty is still asleep ?
Quiet here !
Take them away .
- Yes , sir .
- Shh !
Yes , sir .
Company ... left ... face !
Forward ... on tiptoes ... march !
Good morning , Your Majesty .
Good morning , Your Majesty .
I 'm so hopeful Your Majesty rested well .
Why am I always awakened from my dreams ?
I 'm sure it was a nice dream , Your Majesty .
Oh , it was wonderful .
It was gorgeous .
Mmm .
Oh .
Mmm .
I hope Your Majesty 's dream comes true .
No .
I 'm afraid it will always have to remain ... a dream .
# There 's a land of charm that I know #
# Land of sweet romance where I love to go #
# And its bounds touch my room #
# In the gloom where the shadows creep #
# Someone I meet there waits for me #
# Someone tender as a lover should be #
# And I whisper each night #
# As I close my eyes #
# In sleep #
# Dream lover #
# Fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# I 'm held #
# In your spell #
# Knowing so well #
# Dreams never tell #
# We two can leave the world behind us #
# Nobody indiscreet can find us #
# Oh , dream lover mine #
# Secrets divine #
# I will share them #
# With you #
# Dream lover fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# Oh , my darling I am just longing for a love of my own #
- # Nobody indiscreet can find us # - # Nobody indiscreet can find us , I know #
# Dream lover #
# Secrets divine #
# I will share them #
# With you # #
Please , Your Majesty .
Won 't you tell us more about your dream ?
I 'm afraid I can 't .
It wasn 't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen .
Was it the sort of dream for a lady-in-waiting ?
I hope not .
I had a lovely dream myself ...
about Your Majesty .
I dreamed that Your Majesty got married .
And you call that a lovely dream ?
Why not , Your Majesty ?
We all wish , we all hope , we all pray ...
- that very soon Your Majesty will be ...
- Married .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Marriage .
Marriage .
In all my country , nothing else is ever spoken of .
What do the children learn at school ?
" The queen is unmarried still " .
What do the papers write about ?
" Is the queen to marry ? "
What does my Parliament debate ?
" When shall the queen marry ? "
And from my ministers :
" Whom shall the queen marry ? "
Marriage .
Marriage .
That 's all I hear , morning or night .
Didn 't I tell that conductor never to play the " Wedding March " again ?
But , Your Majesty , it is not the same conductor .
- This is a new one .
- Where 's the old one ?
He is being married today .
Oh .
Oh .
Phew !
- Good morning , gentlemen .
- Good morning , Your Majesty .
Well ?
Whom can you suggest today ?
For what , Your Majesty ?
For my husband .
Now don 't tell me you weren 't talking about it .
You 're always talking about it .
We have no one to suggest , Your Majesty .
We have given the matter up .
- Really ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Oh , what a relief .
Oh , how glad I am .
And , uh ... why have you given the matter up , may I ask ?
Well , uh ...
- You see , it 's rather difficult .
- Very difficult .
Difficult ?
You tell me it 's difficult to find a husband for me ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
Excuse me , Baron .
How does Her Majesty feel today ?
And that 's final , Admiral .
I certainly don 't need any help from the navy .
Yes , Your Majesty .
But surely Your Majesty must realize that the field for selection is limited .
If marrying you were to make a man a king ... that would be different .
But Your Majesty 's husband would be simply prince consort .
After all , what is a prince consort ?
He is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights .
- He has nothing to say , nothing to do .
- Well , I wouldn 't say that .
Of course , he has something to do , naturally .
And yet , uh , he has nothing to do , if you see what I mean .
I see .
He is Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Nothing else ?
- But isn 't it enough to be my husband ?
- But , Your Majesty ...
It never seems to occur to you gentlemen that there might possibly be some men ... who would enjoy being my husband even if I were not a queen .
My face isn 't actually painful to look at .
My complexion 's quite good .
And in case you 're too serious-minded to notice such things ... let me inform you ... my legs are perfect .
There 's only one other leg like that in the whole of Sylvania .
And that 's it .
Do you see ?
Thank you .
I didn 't see , Your Majesty .
How do you think I should behave ?
Should I be humble , proud , apologetic ?
Say as little as possible .
I don 't think your French accent will please Her Majesty .
Is it still very notice-able ?
No .
It 's very noticeable .
Oh .
But that 's terrible .
No .
It 's terrible .
How did you acquire this accent ?
I 'll tell you .
Once , in Paris , I had an awful cold .
I went to see a great French doctor to cure it .
I rang the bell .
The door was opened by a lady .
- Mm-hmm .
- A beautiful lady .
Mm-hmm .
The doctor 's wife .
And in less than a month ...
I had lost my cold ... but I had a terrific French accent .
And if I 'm talked to like this again , I 'll dissolve the cabinet .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- I 'll dismiss the whole general staff .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- And if that band ... plays the " Wedding March " once more ...
- I 'll give orders to shoot !
- Yes , Your Majesty .
I 'm sorry , Count .
You 're next .
- What do you want ?
- Count Alfred Renard ...
Your Majesty 's military attaché at Your Majesty 's embassy in Paris .
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty .
- You 'll have to wait .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- What do you want ?
- Count Alfred Renard ...
Your Majesty 's military attaché at Your Majesty 's embassy in Paris .
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty .
- Didn 't I tell you to wait ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Then wait .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Count .
Count Alfred , I understand you 've been seriously involved ... in a disgraceful affair with a woman .
No , Your Majesty .
With several .
Aren 't you ashamed of yourself ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
I don 't think it 's funny .
I think it 's serious .
Very serious .
- And I shall have to punish you .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- I shall have to punish you very severely .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Otherwise you 'd start all over again .
Yes !
I shall think of a punishment that will cure you forever .
An awful punishment .
Let me see .
An awful punishment .
You shall be ordered ... to grow a beard .
- A beard , Your Majesty ?
- Yes .
That will stop all your philandering .
You 'll have to be serious in a beard .
And am I to be permitted to attend Your Majesty after the beard is grown ?
Certainly .
I shall want to see that my instructions have been obeyed .
Then I fear Your Majesty will regret the order .
I look terrible in a beard .
- Really ?
- Oh , dreadful .
Of course , there are men who look fine in beards , like sheiks .
- Well , yes .
That 's what I thought .
- But I don 't .
- No ?
- Oh !
Oh , I grew one once to see .
Ah , it came out all red and scraggly .
Oh , no .
No , I assure Your Majesty ... it would be the most awful-looking beard in Sylvania .
And ...
That 's saying a great deal .
- Well , then don 't grow it .
- No , Your Majesty .
- Don 't do it .
- No , no , Your Majesty .
- No beard .
- No , no , Your Majesty .
- You promise me .
- My word of honor .
But what can I do with you ?
I 've got to punish you .
May I make a suggestion ?
You want to suggest a punishment for yourself ?
Yes .
Of course .
Please .
Well , tell me .
If I were in Your Majesty 's place ...
I would say this :
" Count Alfred ...
" the sort of life you 've been leading must stop .
You shall not return to Paris " .
Very good .
Then I would say :
- " Alfred " ...
- Hmm ?
" Count Alfred , you shall stay here ...
" in the palace ...
" attached to me .
And from morning till night , never dare to leave my side " .
And you call that a punishment ?
You 're the most impudent man I 've ever met .
You seem to forget you 're talking to your queen .
Count Alfred will dine with me tonight .
At 8 : 00 ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
White uniform .
Yes , Your Majesty .
You understand ?
Oh , yes , I understand .
# With such a bad report of you I wonder what I ought to do with you #
# You really can 't be too severe when my regret is so sincere #

# Let me obey you blindly #
# You mean you 'd really do #

# Everything to please the queen #
# Morning , noon and night #
# I 'm yours to command me #

# You want me bad Then I 'll be bad #

# Remember you 're on trial #
# Will you do as I advise #

# You 'd better wait and see We shall find how good you are #
# I 've had no complaints so far #
- # You mean # - # Anything to please the queen #
# Anything to please the queen # #
Perhaps you didn 't quite follow me , Count .
You 're invited for dinner , not for tea .
I followed Your Majesty perfectly .
Hmm .
Too perfectly , I 'm afraid .
Remember . 8 : 00 .
8 : 00 .
Oh , Count .
Don 't forget .
No beard .
Oh , no , Your Majesty .
# Anything to please the queen Everything to please the queen #
# Morning , noon and night I 'm yours to command # #
Just a minute , monsieur .
In case some lady should telephone , am I to say you have a date with the queen ?
- No lady will telephone .
- But if ?
Impossible .
There is no telephone .
Do you know the story of the Frenchman and the farmer 's daughter ?
I know it .
I am the Frenchman .
You are not .
How do you know ?
I am the farmer 's daughter .
Go home .
Are you talking to me or to the dog ?
- Is this your animal ?
- Yes .
Then take it away .
Don 't you see it is eating out of the same dish as the queen 's dog ?
Listen here .
If my master 's good enough to have dinner with the queen ... then his dog can eat dinner with the queen 's dog .
- So , that 's your master .
- Yes .
- That naughty boy from Paris ?
- Yes .
Do you know why the queen has invited him for dinner ?
Because the king 's away .
There is no king .
- She hasn 't got a husband ?
- No .
Oh .
Now I know why she invited him .
But , gentlemen , even if she liked him , would he be eligible to become the prince consort ?
Why , absolutely .
His great grandfather was the illegitimate son of one king ... and his grandmother the sweetheart of another .
Oh .
I had no idea that he came from such a distinguished family .
And do you think Her Majesty is serious ?
Why , how can you doubt it ?
The first time she sees him , she invites him to dine with her alone .
- And if it goes on at this rate ...
- Then we 're entitled to the highest hopes .
Shh !
They 're coming .
They sit down .
They are seated .
She smiles at him .
He smiles at her .
They both smile ... at each other !
At each other ?
- She is laughing .
- That 's the way they always start .
And how she laughs .
He must have told her the story of the Frenchman and the farmer ...
The lackey is bringing in champagne .
Now they are clinking glasses .
She drinks his health .
He drinks hers .
He tells her , " This is the most beautiful moment of my life " .
How do you know that he does ?
You can 't hear anything .
What else could he say ?
They 've opened the window .
What does it mean ?
- The queen is warm .
- The champagne .
No .
It 's him .
She 's going to her boudoir .
She opens the door .
- She enters the boudoir .
- Heavens !
She beckons to him .
He enters .
She closes the door behind them !
Heaven save the queen !
You know , Count ... this is the first time I 've ever dined with a man alone .
And this is the first time I have ever ...
Don 't lie .
The first time I ever dined with a queen .
But with women ?
Of course .
Of course I have dined with women .
These dinners in Paris ... were charming ?
Yes .
The food in Paris is very , very good .
And the ladies ?
Oh ...
Well , I feel , by comparison ... it must be very dull ... dining with a queen .
It would be the most delightful experience of my life ... dining with a queen , if ...
- If ?
- If one ... could forget ...
That I am a queen .
Yes .
Very well .
Forget it .
I am no longer Queen Louise I of Sylvania ... but a woman .
A mere woman .
And you 're meeting me for the first time .
What would you do ?
Oh .
What would you do ?
Hello , Louise .
All this the first time you meet ?
Yes .
Oh .
Oh , but if it 's like this at first ... what can be left for later ?
Plenty .
If she appeals to you ... and if you find out that you love her ... oh , there 's plenty left ...
- if she were like ...
- Like ?
If she were like ...

Stop .
Stop that whistling .
- It 's unlucky .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
And don 't call me Your Majesty .
I 'm not a king .
Oh , but you 'll be a sensation .
Everyone will applaud when you enter the throne room .
Nonsense .
I feel sure you 'll run away with the wedding .
Now , how do I look ?
I don 't like that medal .
What 's the matter with it ?
The man looks cross-eyed .
Cross-eyed ?
King Stanislaus XXII cross-eyed ?
Oh , no .
No .
That can 't be .
That was never taught at school .
Still looks cross-eyed .
Maybe ...
Maybe it 's a silly superstition ... but each time I have seen a cross-eyed man ...
I 've had bad luck .
To me , it 's even worse than whistling .
Come in .
Her Majesty is ready .
Just a minute , sir .
It 's all right .
# L ong live #

# Serene #
# P roudly #
# # We serve her #
# Here at her command #
# # Queen #
# Of our hearts #
# A nd Sylvania #
# Our land # #
By personal order extraordinary ...
Your Majesty has bestowed upon Count Alfred the title of prince ... and by this merciful act has uplifted him to a station ... where marriage between you is possible .
Is it still Your Majesty 's wish ... to select Prince Alfred as Your Majesty 's husband ?
It is .
Is Your Majesty willing to be a loving wife to the prince consort ?
I am .
And will Your Majesty protect him from all danger ?
I will .
And you , Prince Alfred ... you abide by Her Majesty 's selection ... and are happy to accept the station of prince consort ?
Yes .
You promise always to love Her Majesty ?
Yes , I do .
You promise further to fulfill Her Majesty 's every wish ... to execute Her Majesty 's every command ... and to be an obedient and docile husband ?
- He hesitates .
- Incredible .
- He hesitates at promising to obey .
- And to be docile .
He should 've thought of that before .
Yes , I do .
I pronounce you wife ... and man .
What does he say ?
He says , " Man is man , and woman is woman .
And that to change that causes trouble " .
He does not see how any man could stand being a wife .
And therefore he hopes this will be a most unhappy marriage .
For heaven 's sake .
If he reports this to Afghanistan ...
Tell him this is a love match ... and will be the happiest marriage in the world .
No tschungu .
No tschungu .
No tschungu .
Halt .
Left face .
Have that firing stopped .
- Your Highness , that is impossible .
- Stopped at once .
I can 't .
It 's etiquette .
Etiquette or no etiquette ...
Can 't you understand ?
- Perfectly , sir .
- Ah .
But I can 't help it .
- I command it .
- Very sorry .
I can take orders only from Her Majesty the queen herself .
So .
We shall see .
Alfred ?
Do you hear those cannons ?
Yes .
Isn 't it glorious ?
Our bridal music .
How many ...
How many more shots will there be ?
300 .
What ?
And each time they fire , you shall kiss me .
I wish now I 'd ordered 500 .
399 !
400 .
That was the last .
- Too bad .
- Thank heaven .
I wish we could have a cannon when we get married .
Let 's get married too .
Make it a double wedding .
Jacques .
Jacquesy !
- Lulu .
You 're cross ...
- I 'm not cross .
I 'm thrilled !
Eh , don 't get thrilled .
Perhaps we 'd better wait with our marriage and see how they get on first .
But there 's no chance of their marriage going wrong .
Why , it even started wrong .
What does that lady think she 's marrying ... a trained poodle ?
She is not a lady .
She is a queen .
Well , he 's not a king .
He 's a gentleman .
But when royalty marry , they don 't quarrel like common people do .
They can 't afford to .
That 's just the trouble .
They can 't let off steam with a good old row like you or I.
That 's true .
But we common people can take life easy .
We can act natural , and nobody will care .
We can eat chicken with our fingers .
Look at the names I can call you .
Look at the things I can throw at you .
Oh , it 's wonderful being common .
# Snuggle near , baby dear #
# Why so haughty and severe #
# Let 's get together and cuddle up right here #
# Bear in mind I 'm refined #
# And I 'm not that way inclined #
# Where 's your proper pride #
# Why be so dignified #
# Squeeze me once Squeeze me twice #
# S 'most improper but , oh , it 's nice #
# Let 's be common #
# And do it again #
# Hug me do close to you #
# S 'a beautiful feeling and thrills me through #
# Let 's be common and do it again #
# I 'll surely smother #
# Oh , let me go , sir This isn 't right #
# Oh , darling Mother #
# If you could see your daughter tonight #
# Grip my neck , grab my hand #
# S 'most improper but , oh , it 's grand #
# Let 's be common #
# And do it again #
# S 'a lovely moon S 'a lovely night #
# What 's the matter with you You 're so polite #
# So let 's be common #
# And do it again #
# You crush me I 'll crush you #
# S 'possible we 'll be black-and-blue #
# Let 's be common #
# And do it again #
# Can 't you be gentle #
# You 'll bruise me till I 'm ultramarine #
# Be sentimental #
# But don 't act like a threshing machine #
# So let 's be rough You know how #
# S 'no use struggling Too late now #
# So let 's be common #
# And do it again # #
Don 't do it again !
Ladies and gentlemen ... four weeks ago today , our illustrious queen was married .
The desire of her subjects to celebrate this date ... is readily understood .
But in consideration of the royal honeymoon ...
I must ask the public to refrain just a little longer ... from any serenades , torchlight processions ... or public demonstrations of any kind and , in particular ... to patriotically observe quiet within the limits of the castle ... especially in the early morning hours .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you .
And don 't forget , ladies and gentlemen , this program comes to you ... by courtesy of the Sylvania Hardware Corporation ... the company that gives you two pots for the price of one .
Louise .

Why , you 're up , dear ?
Yes .
I 'm surprised myself .
I might as well lie in bed all day .
I have nothing to get up for .
Well , what a charming reception .
I spend all morning reviewing the household guards , distributing medals ... and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister ...
I steal away to have a look at my husband , and-and ...
He doesn 't even say good morning to me .
Good morning .
Well , that finishes my morning 's work .
What can I do now ?
I have already shaved .
I had my hair cut yesterday .
There 's nothing left .
So , you 're bored .
All I 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me I 'm neglecting you .
Do you realize that not once since we 've been married ... have I left you alone at night ?
And I never will .
Thank you .
It 's very kind of you .
And after this foreign loan is arranged ...
I 'm going to take you to Vienna ... and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms .
That 's it .
You think all you have to do is to buy me a few new uniforms ... and I 'll be satisfied .
That 's the opinion you have of me , is it ?
Oh , don 't be silly , Alfred .
Oh , I 'm sick of being treated as if I were a sort of plaything .
- You 're in a horrible mood today .
- Am I ?
- You have a cold ?
- No .
Why do you cough ?
Listen , Louise .
You have the power to exclude me from all military affairs ... from all cabinet meetings .
But , please , do not interfere with my coughing .
I cough when I want to .
At last , I 've found something to do .
I will repair this today .
Yes .
Immediately after ...
I almost forgot something very important .
Alfred , where are you going ?
Something very important .
I am going to have breakfast .
Where is my breakfast ?
May I remind Your Highness ... that Her Majesty the queen has not as yet appeared .
- Well .
And ?
- Well , I 'm sure Your Highness knows ... that breakfast cannot be served before the appearance of Her Majesty .
I want my breakfast .
Your Highness , I am very sorry .
- We must wait .
- I can 't wait .
I want my breakfast .
I 'm hungry .
Your Highness , I regret it , but it 's impossible to ...
Her Majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning .
Breakfast for His Highness .
Please , Your Highness .
- Do you speak French ?
- No , Your Highness .
You 're the only one in the palace who looks up to me .
# Just look at me #
# I think my heart will break #
# Nobody seems to take me seriously #
# Honestly #
# I 'm just as lonely as a man can be #
# The days mean nothing at all #
# And when the shadows fall #
# The moon is only wasting time on me #
# Candidly #
# There must be something awful wrong #
# With me #
# I have a pair of hands #
# To hug and hold #
# But nobody 's using them now #
# I 've loads of love #
# That could be told #
# But nobody 's using them now #
# I 've a world of time #
# That 's all my own #
# They say that you go silly if you spend it alone #
# I 'm telling the truth I 'm just wasting my youth #
# ' Cause nobody 's using it now No , no , no , no #
# Nobody 's using it now #
# There 's a bridal suite #
# In gold and blue #
# But nobody 's using it now #
# I 've learned to wear pajamas too #
# What 's the use of wearing them now #
# I 've sown wild oats #
# I have indeed #
# But now that I 've stopped sowing them I 'm going to seed #
# For years and for years I 've had great ideas #
# But nobody 's using them now No , no , no , no #
# Nobody 's using them now #
# I have a big settee with patent springs #
# I 've some pleasing ways and ...
other things #
# I 'm a family man who 's out of sorts #
# I 'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts #
# I blush to admit I 've still plenty of " it " #
# But nobody 's using it now No , no , no , no #
# Nobody 's using it now Zum , zum # #
... try to see the prince .
Isn 't there standing room ?
Oh , but I must see the prince .
Oh ?
Oh .
Oh , is that so ?
Mm-hmm .
All right .
The moment it was announced that Your Majesty ... would attend the opening of the opera in person ... the place was completely sold out .
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country .
- Yes , indeed , Your Majesty .
Have the spotlights been focused on the entrance to the opera house ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
Twelve motion picture cameras will photograph the arrival ... of Your Majesty and the prince consort .
The crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm ... that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police .
And has all this been well rehearsed ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
The crowd is the same one that we used at Your Majesty 's wedding .
They all know their parts perfectly .
Good .
Go on .
When Your Majesty and the prince consort appear in the royal box ... the whole audience will rise .
For two minutes , we will have silent homage .
Your Majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles .
You are both in the best of humor .
- In the best of humor ?
- Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
And does the prince consort know he 's to be in the best of humor ?
Well ...
Your Majesty , I-I ...
- Well , you 'd better tell him , to be safe .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Your Majesty frightens us .
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing your matrimonial happiness to the public .
- And if the prince consort does not smile in joy ...
- It will mean disaster .
The diplomatic representatives of the whole world will be guests in the royal box .
And unfortunately , the Afghan ambassador too .
And if he sees any coolness between you , he 'll report it to Afghanistan .
Well , let him .
But surely Your Majesty knows that if Afghanistan hears anything ...
Baluchistan hears it too .
And if Baluchistan hears it , then all Persia will know it .
And what is talked of in Persia spreads all over Turkey .
And when anything is known in Turkey , the Armenians get onto it immediately .
And you know how many Armenians go to America .
So if Wall Street hears of a rift in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty ... it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan .
- And without that loan , we are broke .
- Broke !
So , unless I have a smile on my face tonight , we are broke .
- Yes , Your Highness .
- And you call yourselves statesmen .
Borrowing money is all that you 're able to do .
Prince Alfred , what are you permitting yourself ?
I permit myself to make the following suggestion .
We do not need a loan .
We have enough natural resources .
There is my plan for the national budget .
I have worked out everything ...
in my sleepless days .
The country can be saved without a loan .
Go on .
Read it .
It includes everything .
Even your dressmakers ' bills .
I am not permitted to receive suggestions in the affairs of state ... from the prince consort .
Not even when they are good ?
Not even then .
- Do you speak French ?
- Yes , Your Highness .
Too bad .
Prince Alfred , I must ask you once and for all ... not to interfere in affairs of state .
I know .
I 'm Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Prince Alfred , you may leave the room .
Stay , gentlemen .
Prince Alfred , you will meet me here at 7 : 00 ... in full gala uniform ...
all medals and decorations ... and in the very best of humor .
And in case I don 't feel like complying with Your Majesty 's wish ?
This is not my wish .
It is my command .
If Your Majesty had not already commanded me to smile ...
I would laugh .
# When they went riding yesterday they never spoke a word #
- # You don 't say # - # Is it true #
- # Think of that # - # Who 's to blame #
# And he asked for garlic in his soup at dinner , so I heard #
- # Something 's wrong # - # Did you hear #
- # Are you sure # - # What a shame #
# I know the queen regrets it but of course the man 's to blame #
- # Good for you # - # Not at all #

# Well , here I am , still single May my children stay the same #
# Drink to that Here 's to you #
- # Poor old prince # - # Is that so #
# Don 't you dare to say a word against the queen #
# The queen is always right #
# The queen is just a woman and she 's just as mean #
# Say that again , we 'll fight #
- # Don 't forget she has a husband # - # Don 't forget she is the boss #
# And Her Majesty can run him out of town #
- # The prince is right # - # The queen is right #

# That 's enough from you Sit down # #
You can tell him my patience is exhausted .
If he won 't come here voluntarily , I 'll have him brought here ... even if I have to send soldiers .
Yes , Your Majesty .
His Highness , the prince consort .
Why are you dressed like this ?
What does it mean ?
It means I 'm dressed for traveling .
I 'm going to Paris .
You go change at once .
You 're going to the opera with me .
Only with soldiers and handcuffed .
Alfred , you know very well how much depends on this ... my name , my position , my reputation as queen .
If you fail me tonight , all will be over between us .
It is already over ...
and forever .
- Alfred .
- You have gone too far , madame .
You thought you could order the former military attaché and command the husband .
But you forgot one thing , madame ...
that first , I am a man .
- I know that , Alfred .
- No , you do not .
But I 'm going to prove it to you .
Good-bye , madame .
- You mean you 're really going ?
- Yes .
Oh , but , Alfred , won 't you love me anymore ?
Only with soldiers and handcuffed .
Alfred !
Alfred !

Since you beg me so lovingly ...

You want to humiliate me .
That 's why you came here .
No .
I came because ...
Why ?
Because , after all ...
I didn 't want to ruin the woman I once loved .
But tomorrow , I 'm leaving for Paris .
And as soon as this loan of yours is signed ...
I will file papers for divorce .
If you don 't treat me nicely , I 'll go right home .
All right .
Go on .
Still here ?
If you don 't take those glasses from your eyes , I 'll tear them away .
Go on .
You can 't do it , eh ?
You 're a queen .
You must behave .
If you were just a mere woman , you could make a scandal .
But you can 't .
That 's what you get for being a queen .
Huh ?
Ah , yes .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Oh !
He 'll never get these glasses back .

She is in her room , and he is in his .
Yes .
Sad , isn 't it ?
When we get married , let 's be common ... and only have one room between us .
Why even one room between us ?
Who is it ?
Louise .
What do you want ?
A mouse is in my room .
Call your soldiers .
What are you doing ?
Packing .
- Can I help you ?
- No , thanks .
Please .
The key , please .
So , you 're trying to use force again , madame ?
Where shall we live in Paris ?
- We ?
- Yes .
I 'm going with you .
Wherever you go , I 'll follow you .
You can 't get rid of me .
Well , there is no use for me to leave then .
No .
No use at all .
I suppose I might as well stay here .
I suppose so too .
But how am I going to punish you ?
- And you must be punished .
- Yes .
- And severely .
- Yes .
But how ?
Let me see .
An awful punishment .
Let me see .
It 's really not so easy .
May I ...
May I make a suggestion ?
Yes .
Sit down .
If I were in your place , I 'd say :
" Louise , I don 't want a divorce .
- I love you too much for that " .
- No , no , no , no , no .
But I 'd say : " Louise ...
" you can 't order me around any longer .
" From now on , I shall take command ...
" not only of the affairs of state ...
" not only in the Department of the Navy ... but also here at home " .
And my first command would be ...
" Louise , don 't dare to leave this room .
" You shall stay here ...
" at my side ... attached to me from morning till , uh " ...
" from night till morning " .
And you call that a punishment ?
Yes ... my king .

Count Renard , this scandal will be your last .
At any rate , your last in Paris .
As the ambassador of Sylvania ...
I cannot any longer permit our military attaché to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless escapades .
Your Excellency , please ...
But that is an end .
You will leave at once for Sylvania and report to Her Majesty the queen in person .
But , Your Excellency , I 'm sure the stories you 've heard about me are horribly ... are horribly exaggerated .
Count Renard ... for one week , I made it my business to follow you about personally .
Oh .
I 'm sorry I didn 't know it , Your Excellency .
I would have taken you to some real places .
How dare you .
I know more about you than you think .
My wife has told me everything .
You are to take the first train .
I think I had better take the first airplane .
You are going by plane , monsieur ?
Yes , Jacques .
And I 've got to leave you .
You 're not going to take me with you ?
- I 'm sorry .
- But what will you do without me ?
Think how good I am at making up excuses for you .
Why , I can even imitate your voice on the telephone ... and pretend you 're at home to one lady ... when you 're really having supper with another .
Yes , Jacques .
You 're a very good servant .
And you can tell lies better than anybody I know .
But I won 't need you anymore .
In fact , I will probably be sent to a military prison .
But even so , you 'll need me , monsieur .
Supposing someone you don 't want to see calls at the prison .
Who 's going to tell them you 're not at home ?
I can 't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful Paris .
But , monsieur , I am a Frenchman .
And to be a Frenchman in Paris is nothing ... because everyone in Paris is a Frenchman .
- That 's true .
- But to be a Frenchman in ...
- What is the name of your country ?
- Sylvania .
That is different .
Why , even my stories will be new there .
I can actually tell them the one about the Frenchman and the farmer 's daughter .
Oh , please , monsieur , take me to Pennsylvania .
- Sylvania .
- Take me to Sylvania .
All right , Jacques .
I 'll take you there .
Go and pack the bags .
Oh , thank you .
Thank you , monsieur .
I am so happy .
[ Barks ]
I am not .

Ladies and gentlemen , on your right you see the Royal Opera House .
And on my left , the residence of Her Majesty , Queen Louise I of Sylvania .
The construction of the castle was begun under Maximilian I in 1537 ... and finished in 1687 under Maximilian VIII .
The castle contains one of the most beautiful picture galleries in the world ... and its collection of art treasures is unsurpassed .
The castle represents a value of $ 110 million .
- [ All Murmuring ] - [ Man ] $ 110 million ?
- [ Chattering ] - 110 !

Why , that isn 't a chicken step !
- You blackguards !
- [ Man ] Lieutenant !
Don 't you realize Her Majesty is still asleep ?
Quiet here !
Take them away .
- Yes , sir .
- Shh !
[ Whispers ] Yes , sir .
[ Whispering ] Company ... left ... face !
Forward ... on tiptoes ... march !

Good morning , Your Majesty .
[ Women ] Good morning , Your Majesty .
I 'm so hopeful Your Majesty rested well .
[ Sighs ]
Why am I always awakened from my dreams ?
I 'm sure it was a nice dream , Your Majesty .
Oh , it was wonderful .
It was gorgeous .
[ Sighs ]
Mmm .
Oh .
Mmm .
[ Chuckles ]
I hope Your Majesty 's dream comes true .
No .
I 'm afraid it will always have to remain ... a dream .
# There 's a land of charm that I know #
# Land of sweet romance where I love to go #
# And its bounds touch my room #
# In the gloom where the shadows creep #
# Someone I meet there waits for me #
# Someone tender as a lover should be #
# And I whisper each night #
# As I close my eyes #
# In sleep #
# Dream lover #
# Fold your arms around me #
# Dream lover your romance has found me #
# I 'm held #
# In your spell #
# Knowing so well #
# Dreams never tell #
# We two can leave the world behind us #

- # # [ Vocalizing ] - # Secrets divine #
- # # [ Vocalizing ] - # I will share them #

Please , Your Majesty .
Won 't you tell us more about your dream ?
I 'm afraid I can 't .
It wasn 't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen .
Was it the sort of dream for a lady-in-waiting ?
I hope not .
I had a lovely dream myself ...
about Your Majesty .
I dreamed that Your Majesty got married .
And you call that a lovely dream ?
Why not , Your Majesty ?
We all wish , we all hope , we all pray ...
- that very soon Your Majesty will be ...
- Married .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Marriage .
Marriage .
In all my country , nothing else is ever spoken of .
What do the children learn at school ?
" The queen is unmarried still " .
What do the papers write about ?
" Is the queen to marry ? "
What does my Parliament debate ?
" When shall the queen marry ? "
And from my ministers :
" Whom shall the queen marry ? "
Marriage .
Marriage .
That 's all I hear , morning or night .
# # [ " Wedding March " ]
Didn 't I tell that conductor never to play the " Wedding March " again ?
But , Your Majesty , it is not the same conductor .
- This is a new one .
- Where 's the old one ?
He is being married today .
Oh .
Oh .
Phew !
# # [ Continues ]
- # # [ Ends ] - # # [ Trumpet Fanfare ]
- Good morning , gentlemen .
- Good morning , Your Majesty .
Well ?
Whom can you suggest today ?
For what , Your Majesty ?
For my husband .
Now don 't tell me you weren 't talking about it .
You 're always talking about it .
We have no one to suggest , Your Majesty .
We have given the matter up .
- Really ?
- [ Ministers ] Yes , Your Majesty .
Oh , what a relief .
[ Chuckles ]
Oh , how glad I am .
[ Chuckles ]
And , uh ... why have you given the matter up , may I ask ?
- Well , uh ...
- [ All Clearing Throats ]
- You see , it 's rather difficult .
- [ Ministers ] Very difficult .
Difficult ?
You tell me it 's difficult to find a husband for me ?
[ Ministers ] Yes , Your Majesty .
Excuse me , Baron .
How does Her Majesty feel today ?
[ Louise ] And that 's final , Admiral .
I certainly don 't need any help from the navy .
Yes , Your Majesty .
But surely Your Majesty must realize that the field for selection is limited .
If marrying you were to make a man a king ... that would be different .
But Your Majesty 's husband would be simply prince consort .
After all , what is a prince consort ?
He is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights .
- He has nothing to say , nothing to do .
- Well , I wouldn 't say that .
[ Whispering ]
Of course , he has something to do , naturally .
And yet , uh , he has nothing to do , if you see what I mean .
I see .
He is Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Nothing else ?
- But isn 't it enough to be my husband ?
- But , Your Majesty ...
It never seems to occur to you gentlemen that there might possibly be some men ... who would enjoy being my husband even if I were not a queen .
My face isn 't actually painful to look at .
My complexion 's quite good .
And in case you 're too serious-minded to notice such things ... let me inform you ... my legs are perfect .
There 's only one other leg like that in the whole of Sylvania .
And that 's it .
Do you see ?
Thank you .
I didn 't see , Your Majesty .
[ Whispering ] How do you think I should behave ?
Should I be humble , proud , apologetic ?
Say as little as possible .
I don 't think your French accent will please Her Majesty .
[ Strong French Accent ] Is it still very notice-able ?
No .
It 's very noticeable .
[ French Pronunciation ] Oh .
But that 's terrible .
No .
It 's terrible .
How did you acquire this accent ?
[ Chuckles ] I 'll tell you .
Once , in Paris , I had an awful cold .
I went to see a great French doctor to cure it .
I rang the bell .
The door was opened by a lady .
- Mm-hmm .
- A beautiful lady .
Mm-hmm .
The doctor 's wife .
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
And in less than a month ...
I had lost my cold ... but I had a terrific French accent .
[ Louise ] And if I 'm talked to like this again , I 'll dissolve the cabinet .
- [ Minister ] Yes , Your Majesty .
- I 'll dismiss the whole general staff .
- [ Minister # 2 ] Yes , Your Majesty .
- And if that band ... plays the " Wedding March " once more ...
- I 'll give orders to shoot !
- [ Ministers ] Yes , Your Majesty .
I 'm sorry , Count .
You 're next .
- What do you want ?
- Count Alfred Renard ...
Your Majesty 's military attaché at Your Majesty 's embassy in Paris .
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty .
- You 'll have to wait .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- What do you want ?
- Count Alfred Renard ...
Your Majesty 's military attaché at Your Majesty 's embassy in Paris .
Ordered home for an audience with Your Majesty .
- Didn 't I tell you to wait ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Then wait .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Count .
Count Alfred , I understand you 've been seriously involved ... in a disgraceful affair with a woman .
No , Your Majesty .
With several .
Aren 't you ashamed of yourself ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
[ Both Chuckling ]
I don 't think it 's funny .
I think it 's serious .
Very serious .
- And I shall have to punish you .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- I shall have to punish you very severely .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Otherwise you 'd start all over again .
[ Chuckles ] Yes !
I shall think of a punishment that will cure you forever .
An awful punishment .
Let me see .
An awful punishment .
You shall be ordered ... to grow a beard .
- A beard , Your Majesty ?
- Yes .
That will stop all your philandering .
You 'll have to be serious in a beard .
And am I to be permitted to attend Your Majesty after the beard is grown ?
Certainly .
I shall want to see that my instructions have been obeyed .
Then I fear Your Majesty will regret the order .
I look terrible in a beard .
- Really ?
- Oh , dreadful .
[ Chuckles ] Of course , there are men who look fine in beards , like sheiks .
- Well , yes .
That 's what I thought .
- But I don 't .
- No ?
- Oh !
Oh , I grew one once to see .
Ah , it came out all red and scraggly .
Oh , no .
No , I assure Your Majesty ... it would be the most awful-looking beard in Sylvania .
And ... [ Chuckles ] That 's saying a great deal .
- Well , then don 't grow it .
- No , Your Majesty .
- Don 't do it .
- No , no , Your Majesty .
- No beard .
- No , no , Your Majesty .
- You promise me .
- My word of honor .
But what can I do with you ?
I 've got to punish you .
May I make a suggestion ?
You want to suggest a punishment for yourself ?
Yes .
Of course .
Please .
Well , tell me .
If I were in Your Majesty 's place ...
I would say this :
" Count Alfred ...
" the sort of life you 've been leading must stop .
You shall not return to Paris " .
Very good .
Then I would say :
- " Alfred " ...
- Hmm ?
" Count Alfred , you shall stay here ...
" in the palace ...
" attached to me .
And from morning till night , never dare to leave my side " .
And you call that a punishment ?
- [ Chuckles ]
- You 're the most impudent man I 've ever met .
You seem to forget you 're talking to your queen .
[ Rings ]
Count Alfred will dine with me tonight .
At 8 : 00 ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
- White uniform .
- [ Chuckles ]
Yes , Your Majesty .
You understand ?
Oh , yes , I understand .
# With such a bad report of you I wonder what I ought to do with you #

[ Jacques ] Just a minute , monsieur .
In case some lady should telephone , am I to say you have a date with the queen ?
- No lady will telephone .
- But if ?
Impossible .
There is no telephone .
[ Laughs ]
Do you know the story of the Frenchman and the farmer 's daughter ?
I know it .
I am the Frenchman .
You are not .
How do you know ?
I am the farmer 's daughter .
Go home .
Are you talking to me or to the dog ?
- Is this your animal ?
- Yes .
Then take it away .
Don 't you see it is eating out of the same dish as the queen 's dog ?
Listen here .
If my master 's good enough to have dinner with the queen ... then his dog can eat dinner with the queen 's dog .
- So , that 's your master .
- Yes .
- That naughty boy from Paris ?
- Yes .
Do you know why the queen has invited him for dinner ?
Because the king 's away .
There is no king .
- She hasn 't got a husband ?
- No .
Oh .
Now I know why she invited him .
[ Whispered Chattering ]
But , gentlemen , even if she liked him , would he be eligible to become the prince consort ?
Why , absolutely .
His great grandfather was the illegitimate son of one king ... and his grandmother the sweetheart of another .
- Oh .
- [ All Murmuring ]
I had no idea that he came from such a distinguished family .
And do you think Her Majesty is serious ?
Why , how can you doubt it ?
The first time she sees him , she invites him to dine with her alone .
- And if it goes on at this rate ...
- Then we 're entitled to the highest hopes .
- [ Chattering ]
- Shh !
They 're coming .
They sit down .
They are seated .
She smiles at him .
He smiles at her .
They both smile ... at each other !
At each other ?
[ Murmuring ]
- She is laughing .
- That 's the way they always start .
And how she laughs .
He must have told her the story of the Frenchman and the farmer ...
The lackey is bringing in champagne .
- Now they are clinking glasses .
- [ Murmuring ]
- She drinks his health .
- [ Murmuring ]
He drinks hers .
He tells her , " This is the most beautiful moment of my life " .
How do you know that he does ?
You can 't hear anything .
- What else could he say ?
- [ Chattering ]
They 've opened the window .
What does it mean ?
- The queen is warm .
- The champagne .
No .
It 's him .
She 's going to her boudoir .
She opens the door .
[ Whispering ]
- She enters the boudoir .
- Heavens !
She beckons to him .
He enters .
[ Chattering Excitedly ]
She closes the door behind them !
Heaven save the queen !
You know , Count ... this is the first time I 've ever dined with a man alone .
And this is the first time I have ever ...
Don 't lie .
The first time I ever dined with a queen .
But with women ?
[ Chuckles ]
Of course .
[ Chuckles ]
Of course I have dined with women .
These dinners in Paris ... were charming ?
Yes .
[ Chuckles ]
The food in Paris is very , very good .
And the ladies ?
Oh ...
[ Chuckles Nervously , Mumbles ]
Well , I feel , by comparison ... it must be very dull ... dining with a queen .
It would be the most delightful experience of my life ... dining with a queen , if ...
- If ?
- If one ... could forget ...
That I am a queen .
Yes .
Very well .
Forget it .
I am no longer Queen Louise I of Sylvania ... but a woman .
A mere woman .
And you 're meeting me for the first time .
What would you do ?
Oh .
[ Chuckles ]
What would you do ?
Hello , Louise .
[ Chuckles ]
All this the first time you meet ?
Yes .
Oh .
Oh , but if it 's like this at first ... what can be left for later ?
Plenty .
If she appeals to you ... and if you find out that you love her ... oh , there 's plenty left ...
- if she were like ...
- Like ?
If she were like ...

By personal order extraordinary ...
Your Majesty has bestowed upon Count Alfred the title of prince ... and by this merciful act has uplifted him to a station ... where marriage between you is possible .
Is it still Your Majesty 's wish ... to select Prince Alfred as Your Majesty 's husband ?
It is .
Is Your Majesty willing to be a loving wife to the prince consort ?
I am .
And will Your Majesty protect him from all danger ?
I will .
And you , Prince Alfred ... you abide by Her Majesty 's selection ... and are happy to accept the station of prince consort ?
Yes .
You promise always to love Her Majesty ?
Yes , I do .
You promise further to fulfill Her Majesty 's every wish ... to execute Her Majesty 's every command ... and to be an obedient and docile husband ?

They can 't afford to .
That 's just the trouble .
They can 't let off steam with a good old row like you or I.
That 's true .
But we common people can take life easy .

Ladies and gentlemen ... four weeks ago today , our illustrious queen was married .
The desire of her subjects to celebrate this date ... is readily understood .
But in consideration of the royal honeymoon ...
I must ask the public to refrain just a little longer ... from any serenades , torchlight processions ... or public demonstrations of any kind and , in particular ... to patriotically observe quiet within the limits of the castle ... especially in the early morning hours .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you .
And don 't forget , ladies and gentlemen , this program comes to you ... by courtesy of the Sylvania Hardware Corporation ... the company that gives you two pots for the price of one .

I spend all morning reviewing the household guards , distributing medals ... and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister ...
I steal away to have a look at my husband , and-and ...
He doesn 't even say good morning to me .
Good morning .
Well , that finishes my morning 's work .
What can I do now ?
I have already shaved .
I had my hair cut yesterday .
There 's nothing left .
So , you 're bored .
All I 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me I 'm neglecting you .
Do you realize that not once since we 've been married ... have I left you alone at night ?
And I never will .
Thank you .
It 's very kind of you .
And after this foreign loan is arranged ...
I 'm going to take you to Vienna ... and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms .
That 's it .
You think all you have to do is to buy me a few new uniforms ... and I 'll be satisfied .
That 's the opinion you have of me , is it ?
Oh , don 't be silly , Alfred .
Oh , I 'm sick of being treated as if I were a sort of plaything .
- You 're in a horrible mood today .
- Am I ?
[ Rhythmic Tapping ]
[ Coughing ]
- You have a cold ?
- No .
- [ Coughing ]
- Why do you cough ?
Listen , Louise .
You have the power to exclude me from all military affairs ... from all cabinet meetings .
But , please , do not interfere with my coughing .
I cough when I want to .
[ Exaggerated Coughing ]
[ Cough ]
At last , I 've found something to do .
I will repair this today .
Yes .
Immediately after ...
I almost forgot something very important .
Alfred , where are you going ?
Something very important .
I am going to have breakfast .
Where is my breakfast ?
May I remind Your Highness ... that Her Majesty the queen has not as yet appeared .
- Well .
And ?
- Well , I 'm sure Your Highness knows ... that breakfast cannot be served before the appearance of Her Majesty .
I want my breakfast .
Your Highness , I am very sorry .
- We must wait .
- I can 't wait .
I want my breakfast .
I 'm hungry .
Your Highness , I regret it , but it 's impossible to ...
Her Majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning .
Breakfast for His Highness .
Please , Your Highness .
- Do you speak French ?
- No , Your Highness .

Isn 't there standing room ?
Oh , but I must see the prince .
[ Chattering Continues ]
Oh ?
Oh .
Oh , is that so ?
Mm-hmm .
All right .
The moment it was announced that Your Majesty ... would attend the opening of the opera in person ... the place was completely sold out .
[ Ministers Chattering ]
- Your Majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country .
- [ Minister ] Yes , indeed , Your Majesty .
Have the spotlights been focused on the entrance to the opera house ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
Twelve motion picture cameras will photograph the arrival ... of Your Majesty and the prince consort .
The crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm ... that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police .
And has all this been well rehearsed ?
Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
The crowd is the same one that we used at Your Majesty 's wedding .
They all know their parts perfectly .
Good .
Go on .
When Your Majesty and the prince consort appear in the royal box ... the whole audience will rise .
For two minutes , we will have silent homage .
Your Majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles .
You are both in the best of humor .
- In the best of humor ?
- Oh , yes , Your Majesty .
And does the prince consort know he 's to be in the best of humor ?
Well ... [ Coughs ] Your Majesty , I-I ...
- Well , you 'd better tell him , to be safe .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Your Majesty frightens us .
Tonight is your first opportunity of showing your matrimonial happiness to the public .
- And if the prince consort does not smile in joy ...
- It will mean disaster .
The diplomatic representatives of the whole world will be guests in the royal box .
And unfortunately , the Afghan ambassador too .
And if he sees any coolness between you , he 'll report it to Afghanistan .
Well , let him .
But surely Your Majesty knows that if Afghanistan hears anything ...
Baluchistan hears it too .
And if Baluchistan hears it , then all Persia will know it .
And what is talked of in Persia spreads all over Turkey .
And when anything is known in Turkey , the Armenians get onto it immediately .
And you know how many Armenians go to America .
So if Wall Street hears of a rift in the matrimonial happiness of Your Majesty ... it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan .
- And without that loan , we are broke .
- [ Ministers ] Broke !
[ Door Slams ]
So , unless I have a smile on my face tonight , we are broke .
- [ Ministers ] Yes , Your Highness .
- And you call yourselves statesmen .
Borrowing money is all that you 're able to do .
Prince Alfred , what are you permitting yourself ?
I permit myself to make the following suggestion .
We do not need a loan .
We have enough natural resources .
There is my plan for the national budget .
[ Whispered Chattering ]
I have worked out everything ...
in my sleepless days .
The country can be saved without a loan .
Go on .
Read it .
It includes everything .
Even your dressmakers ' bills .
I am not permitted to receive suggestions in the affairs of state ... from the prince consort .
Not even when they are good ?
Not even then .
- Do you speak French ?
- Yes , Your Highness .
Too bad .
Prince Alfred , I must ask you once and for all ... not to interfere in affairs of state .
I know .
I 'm Your Majesty 's husband and nothing else .
Prince Alfred , you may leave the room .
Stay , gentlemen .
Prince Alfred , you will meet me here at 7 : 00 ... in full gala uniform ...
all medals and decorations ... and in the very best of humor .
And in case I don 't feel like complying with Your Majesty 's wish ?
This is not my wish .
It is my command .
If Your Majesty had not already commanded me to smile ...
I would laugh .

Little child , how did you end up here ... ?
... l tell you , you 'll bitterly regret this !
That 's Dr. Vitalis - he always wants to save us but in the end he joins us .
You look like you 're at a funeral , dear friend :
try and be a li 'l happy !
Today 's your birthday ?
l know how l 'll help :
we 'll do a lottery for you .
Once a year the pharmacist takes his wife out on the town .
So here you have the seamy side of the big city .
And what can you win with the lot ?
Yes , Thymian , now you are a lost-girl -
- just as we 're all lost !
Three years have passed since the painful meeting between father and daughter .
Thymian still leads the same life .
After a brief , trying illness , my beloved husband , the pharmacist Karl Friedrich Henning
passed away yesterday , on the 17th of June , 1929 .
INHERITANCE NOTICES
Thymian Henning , as legal heir to Herr Henning 's estate , is requested to attend the reading of the will , which will take place in the house of the deceased .
Money will enter the house - over a short course - by way of a dark lady !
Why , you 're rich !
Yes , l could start another life -
For another life - you need a new identity !
He should marry her !
Countess Thymian Osdorff :
there 's an identity !
You insist on exercising your right to take over the pharmacy .... ... and drive your friend 's poor widow out of her home ?
Countess , Herr Meinert has redeemed the mortgage of 45.000 marks that you inherited from your mother ... and thus becomes the sole owner of the pharmacy .
Here is the money .
Filthy slut !
The money !
Where 's all the money ?
- l gave it to my little sister , so she doesn 't end up like me .
And me ?
Am l to blame in the end ?
I , his uncle , bear most of the blame .
l should never have repudiated that helpless lad !
May l attempt to repay you with the debt l owe him ?
We 're now in Swinemünde .
Uncle Osdorff is so kind to me .
My former life often seems like an ugly , terrible dream .
Cousin Osdorff - !
My niece - Countess Osdorff :
Little Thymian , you don 't recognize me any more ?
Dear Countess , l hope you 'll let me take care of you .
I 'd like - for us to leave !
We beg you , dear Countess , to work with us in our society for saving wayward young girls .
Countess Thymian Osdorff is invited to the board meeting and to examine our institution on 19 August 1929 .
Our youngest member - Countess Osdorff .
Today we have an especially difficult case .
A young girl has once again been entrusted to us .... ... who has struck down our every educational measure by repeatedly running away .
How we 've worried about her -
Fabulous !
My dear , try the soup they make here !
Yet she constantly turns away from the blessings of our home -
l know this house and its " blessings " -
Your ignorance won 't help her - l want to try , for l was once what she is .
A little more love and no-one would be lost in this world !

How are you feeling now , Kitty ?
I 'm all right .
You lay down during the intermisson and I 'll give you a couple of shots .
I 'll lay down but I don 't want any shots .
Telegram for you , Kitty .
For God 's sake , give me .
Nothing serious , I hope , Kitty .
No , it 's nothing .
Kitty , Kitty .
There 's more .

Take it easy , boys .
Hey , boys , don 't forget .

Hey , is there a doctor in the house ?
No foolin , boys .
Is there a doctor in the house ?
All right , What 's the answer to that ?
Is Dr. Leonard here ?
Is Dr. Leonard here ?

What do you want ?
Come backstage , doc .

Hey doc , how did you ever get away from the office ?
Right this way , doctor .
All of you on the other side of the stage .
I 'll take you to the dressing room .
Stay in your pallet .
No , no , right of center door .
That 's right .
Oh , I don 't get clothes .
Go on to your dressing-room , quick !
Something she ate ?
No , she hasn 't been feeling so good for a couple of days .
And then when we came off this number she got this telegram and passed out .
What 's it all about ?
It 's from her husband .
He got sent up for croaking a big bum with an itch for Kitty .
Eddie was a swell fellow .
But he didn 't belong to this racket .
Crazy about Kitty .
Jealous of everybody .
But that 's no way to be in the Burlesque game .
No , I guess not .
Gee , it 's tough on Kitty , though .
Will she be able to go on again tonight , doc ?
No , sir .
Nor for many an acts to come .
Send one of the boys across the street for my surgical bag , will you ?
Sure .
Is there anything very serious ?
No , not if we work fast .
Hey , you .
Come in here .
I 'll need you .
On stage everybody .
Step on it .
Come on , get on there .
Hurry up , Joe .
It 's your entrance .
Well , Maude Adams ?
How about getting out there and giving the cast a little of your time , eh ?
What 's the matter with you ?
You 're not getting out there ?
Kitty 's got a baby .
Well I 'll be .
She 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .

What ?

Come on in , boys and girls , we got company .
Gee , Kitty , the baby looks great .
Oh , isn 't it cute ?
It looks just like Kitty .
Oh , what a beautiful baby !
Watch that left foot there , precious .
That 's right .
That 's fine .
That 's momma 's big girl .
Come in .
Uncle Joe !
Well , how 's my best girl today ?
Fine .
Now , Kitty , I got good news .
Just came from Maxmount 's office
And you and the Highflying Company is all set .
Thirty weeks date , you open in Toledo .
Did you make it plain about my billing ?
Oh , yeah .
He came through without a squawk .
And as for you , Snoops , look what I got for you .
From one comic to another .
Mommy , look !
Oh , Joe , that 's swell .
Come on , little monkey , you run over there .
Try 'em on , see how they look .
Listen , Kitty , I 've been thinking a lot lately about you .
What you two need is a man like me to take care of you .
Kitty Darling don 't need any man to take care of her .
Ain 't she getting along pretty well without one now ?
If you 'd leave it to me I 'd buy a cosy little home some place for you , Nicky .
where she could grow up right .
A home for me , eh ?
You want lumps growing on me , I suppose .
No , Mr. King , I got plans .
I 'm headed straight for Broadway , the big time .
No foolin ' , Kitty .
The kid deserves a better break .
Why , this burlesque racket is no place for her .
I can take plenty care of her , thanks .
Yeah , I know .
But she 's getting to the age where she 's learning things whether you like it or not .
Why , last night I overheard her trying to tell the one that the girls brought back from the elf 's backyard .
Look .
Look .
You see what I mean ?
Yes , maybe you 're right .
But , Joe , what can I do ?
Listen , I got a cousin that 'll send your kid to a nice school in Wisconsin .
A convent .
Take April away from me ?
The Blessed Heart .
She said it was great .
Oh , no , Joe .
I couldn 't .
I couldn 't .
I 'd die .
It 's for her own good , Kitty .
Honest .
She 'd get an education .
Grow up at a nice place .
Not in some lousy burlesque theater .
No sleeper jumps and none of the small town johns hanging around at nights .
And there 'll be sisters there to teach her the word of God .
And she 'd grow up in a nice place , grow up to be a lady .
not a cheap little tot .
You want April to be a lady , don 't you ?
You bet she 's gonna be a lady .
I got plans for her .
Then you 'd better send her to that convent .
Maybe I will .
Maybe I will .
Let us contemplate in its mystery how our Lord , Jesus Christ being sentenced to die bore with great patience the cross which was laid upon him for his greater torment and ignominy .
And now , April , there 's a little prayer that goes with this , dear .
It goes like this .
Oh , Holy Virgin , example of patience .
by the most painful carrying of the cross on which thy son , our Lord Jesus Christ , bore the heavy weight of our sins , obtain for us of Him , by thy intersession , courage and strength to follow His steps
And bear our cross after Him to the end of our lives ,
Amen .
I know he loves me , heaven knows why
And when he tells me he can 't live without me what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
He 's not an angel or saint ,
I know he loves me , heaven knows why and when he tells me he can 't live without me what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
I 'll never leave him alone , I 'll make his troubles my own
With all his faults I know we 'll get by
I 'm just no good when his arms are about me what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
Give me air .
After that one I 'd better get out of here while I 'm still alive .
Come on , Hitch , stick around .
It 's early .
I can 't , Peggy .
Honest .
Kitty 'll be sore .
Anybody 'd think she got a mortgage on you .
You see that rock ?
As long as she keeps kicking in with little love tokens like that , sweetness ,
I 'm gonna keep right on being her wide-bedded boy .
Okay , big boy .
As long as she doesn 't get wise that you 're giving the runaround with every dame in the coop .
When she does , I 'll get me a new mama , peaches .
And your name 's right on top of the list .
Aw , baloney .
I loved that man from the start and way down deep in my heart
I know he loves me , heaven knows why and when he tells me he can 't live without me
What wouldn 't I do ...
Hello , beautiful !
Gee , you gave me a start .
Ain 't you home early ?
Well , I dumped the gang , luscious .
Had to come home to my big blonde mama .
Oh , honey .
My own sweet boy .
What 's all that stuff ?
Forget-me-nots ?
Just a lot of old letters and junk .
Hey , what john wrote your loads ?
You ain 't the first good-looking guy in my life .
But the last , eh ?
Who 's the dame ?
Give me that .
Wait a minute , can 't you ?
What 's the rush ?
Cute kid .
Sister ?
To my own darling mama .
Give me that .
Hey !
What 's that mean " To my own darling mama " , eh ?
You can read , can 't you ?
You mean to tell me this kid 's yours ?
Well , is it ?
Well , what if she is ?
You 've been holding out on me .
Shut up .
You 're all alike .
Just a lot of dirty double-crossing broads .
How old is the kid ?
Seventeen .
Where 's she at ?
In school .
In a convent .
That 's a laugh .
What for ?
I got plans for her .
I want her to have an education .
Yeah , but I always thought those joints were so expensive .
I manage to round up a coin every month .
So that 's where all your spare cash goes .
No wonder you didn 't have 100 bucks to loan me Monday .
But when I do have it to loan , what do you do with it ?
Drop it in some bookie 's lap .
Well , I 'm not thinking of myself so much now , see ?
But you oughta be sore if I go away .
Sure , you got a great career .
But it takes plenty of jack as well as talent to make the grade .
I got plenty of both , I guess .
Speaking of that , how about that act of ours you said the Keith Office was interested in ?
There you are , you see ?
That 's gonna cost about $ 1200 to mount .
Classy looking props , three changes for you , orchestrations and I 'll bet you ain 't got $ 1200 .
Maybe not .
But you said you 'd help , remember ?
Now , that ring I gave you .
I knew that was coming .
Hawk it , eh ?
That 's all the sentiment you got in ya .
Hawk that new overcoat you got me too , I suppose .
No , I want you to look nice .
Yeah , well ...
I guess I 'm gonna be the little old excess baggage around here from now on .
I can see you 've been playing me for a sucker .
Just a goodtime pal to keep you from getting lonesome on sleeper-jumps .
I 've been nuts about you .
But I 'm wise now .
Hitch , what are you driving at ?
I guess I got sense enough to know when I 'm through .
You 're not walking out on me ?
What do you expect me to do after the deal you 've given me ?
What deal , honey , what are you talking about ?
When we made our bargain it was gonna be 50 / 50 and no holding out on each other , right ?
Now what ?
I find out you got a kid seventeen and you 've been blowing your dough up .
Dough we need for ourselves , for our future , for your career .
What can I do , she 's my daughter , ain 't she ?
I 'll tell you what you can do .
You don 't have to keep her in some expensive dump like that , do you ?
Now get the kid down here .
Take her out of school ?
Make her go to work .
She 's old enough .
I wanna keep my baby out of show business .
Okay , Kitty , that 's my answer .
Wait a second .
Give me time to think .
There ain 't nothing to think about .
It 's her or me .
That 's flat .
All right , if you think that 's the right thing to do .
Why , sure it is , babes .
It 's time you did something for yourself instead of dishing out the gravy for someone else like you do .
One thing no , Hitch .
She ain 't going in to show business .
I 'll get her a job outside some place .
Okay , Kitty , just so long as she holds up our own name .
Now you sit right down here and write her a little letter .
Now , Hitch , don 't be cross at me , but don 't you think we oughta think this over a little ?
Honest , the way you rush me into things sometimes ...
Will you just stop fussing and write to her ?
You 've been saving and scrimping all your life to keep this jane in school .
Now it 's her turn to do something for you .
Help you put away a little money for a rainy day , right ?
Oh , I don 't know ...
You got a great career , babes .
She oughta be proud to help you , proud to be Kitty Darling 's daughter , right ?
Why , I know so .
She ain 't as good looking as her ma ... maybe she takes after her old man .
Instead you can depend on me , Kitty baby , to treat her right for your sake .
Why , we 'll just be one big happy family .
One big happy family .
May God 's love and kindness guide you .
As you go forth into the great world outside these gates ... and keep you from all harm till we meet again .
That is my prayer for you .
Little angel .
Goodbye .
Looking for somebody , honey ?
Yes , I ...
Mr. Greeley .
Mr. Greeley .
Cash customer .
I 'm supposed to meet my mother here , Miss Darling .
Oh , so you 're Kitty Darling 's little girl , eh ?
Well , I 'm a couple of cockeyed sewing sewers .
My name 's Eddy Vermont .
I 'm in the merry-merry too .
One of your momma 's best pals .
Put it back here .
How do you do , Mr. Vermont ?
Your ma is up at the theater .
She wants you to wait upstairs till she gets back .
Oh , how long will I have to wait to see her ?
Not more than an hour or so .
These uptown grind joints get out early .
I 'll show you to the rooms .
Thank you .
You got a great ma , Miss Darling .
And believe me , she sure knows her stuff .
That Swedish movement of hers has been laying 'em in the aisles ever since I was a pup .
Swedish movement ?
I mean the way Kitty slams over her number .
And boy , she packs the meanest strip and teaser routine that ever burned a Verona way .
You know what I mean .
Not exactly .
I haven 't seen my mother on the stage since I was five .
No ?
But I remember she was wonderful .
I 'll say so .
Say , I got a bright idea .
Instead of hanging around this dump , why don 't you grab the Lexington Ave .
local and go up and catch the show ?
Do you really think I could ?
Sure .
I can 't take you myself , I have a heavy date .
But my kid brother , Slim , he 'll take you .
He 's a nice guy , too .
Okay with you ?
Yes .
All right , I 'll get him right down .
512 , sweetheart .
Slim ?
Come right down .
I got a job for you .
Yeah , yeah .
Sorry the seats ain 't so hot but the show 's almost over .
Sit down !
What are you looking at , punk ?
We oughta pension off that faded old blonde .
Yeah , she 's all worked up anyway , look at that .
Let 's go away from here , please .
Okay , I 'll take you back to your ma .
All right .
All right , tag along this side .
Mommy !
April , baby !
I don 't know whether I done right bringing her up here , Kitty .
but she was all harped up in seeing you .
We thought it would be a nice surprise .
It sure was , you did just right .
Oh , my , look at this girl ...
Well , guess I 'll be edging along .
So long everybody .
Bye .
You look like an old lady .
Oh , mother , mommy !
Oh , dear .
You 're so pretty .
Ain 't she , Hitch ?
Yes .
Oh , this is Hitch Nelson .
He 's the Hitch I 've been writing you about .
How do you do , Mr. Nelson ?
Make it Hitch , kid .
We 're all pals together .
What do you think of my great big girl .
A litttle skinny .
Ah , Hitchy .
Ain 't he a lemon , though ?
Honest , the things he says to people I meet .
He 's a bad one .
He don 't mean nothing by it .
Now you sit down here .
Say , you better finish your change , beautiful .
You only got a couple of minutes .
Yeah , that 's right .
If I had known I could have company like this I ... oooh !
like this , well ...
Angel baby , just as soon as we get out of this joint we 'll go down to Gialetta 's and we 'll sit on the swellest place you ever saw and stuff ourselves flat in the face .
Up short , Kitty .
All right , all right .
Come on , watch me finish the show .
I 'd rather stay here if you don 't mind .
All right for you then .
Kick 'er up , honey .
Got any ideas about going into show business ?
No .
Why not ?
Don 't you like it ?
No .
You 're a funny kid .
Oh , don 't jump .
I ain 't gonna bite .
Did you hear that ?
Suppose that was for you , huh ?
Everybody in the whole damn house clapping and yelling .
Going nuts about ya .
Nice ?
No ?
Why not ?
You 're a funny kid .
Just a little bit goofy .
But that 's what comes from not knowing what it 's all about .
Please , Mr. Nelson .
Didn 't I ask you to call me Hitch ?
I wanna be your pal , see ?
And if you listen to me you 'll let me learn you a couple of dance routines to put you in the show .
No , thank you .
I 'm pretty sure I don 't want to be in the show .
But you 've got the makings of a great artist .
With your looks and my training it 's Broadway for you , no foolin ' .
You take the word of an old cue man .
That 's the finale .
Gotta go .
Seeya later , kid .
... and give your baby nights a lovin ' ...
Open up your eyes and open up your lips
Why don 't you try to get some sleep , precious ?
I can 't .
You oughta be plenty tired after your trip and all .
Oh , I 'm tired enough but ...
I don 't know .
I feel funny .
All mixed up inside .
Why , precious .
What 's the matter ?
Tell mother what 's the matter .
Everything is so different from what I thought it would be .
Sure .
You ain 't in a convent anymore .
But ain 't you glad to be back with me again ?
Yes , mommy darling , but ...
I don 't know how to describe it .
But New York 's too big , dirty and noisy .
And your theater with all those men ... and the girls with no clothes on .
Oh , I suppose it does seem queer to you .
Coming from a place where they cover everything but their noses .
But things ain 't as bad as that .
It ain 't what you do so much .
It 's what you are .
That 's it .
It 's what you are .
Why there 's a couple of dames in this troupe good at things you 'd never expect to see , even if they do make their living shaking .
I ain 't ashamed of it .
You shouldn 't be ashamed of me neither .
Oh , mommy , I 'm not ashamed of you .
Let me tell you something , April , baby .
If it wasn 't for the dough I 've been piling up that way in the last 10 or 12 years you would never have been to no convent .
I know .
I know .
That 's what I 've been thinking .
I 'm just beginning to realize that .
All these things you 've gone through and I never knew .
Dancing with those girls .
Horrible men staring at you .
Saying awful things .
Now don 't you think I 'm going to be in this burlesque racket all my life neither .
Just one more season with my name on Broadway in lights .
And the big dough .
Then we 'll have a nice little home .
And we 'll be together and be happy .
Oh , mommy .
You 've done so much to make me happy .
From now on I 'll try and make you just as happy .
Oh , I ain 't done nothing .
But we 've got each other from now on and it 's gonna be for always .
Yes , for always .
And we 'll be so happy together .
Just you and I.
You said it .
After all , snooks , things can 't be all bad as long as we got each other .
Don 't you forget that .
Now you go to sleep , now .
Close your pretty eyes and close your pretty lips and give your baby nights a loving ...
Mommy , about Mr. Nelson
What about him ?
I don 't think he likes me .
Aw , he 's crazy about you .
Why , he said so .
Are you going to be married ?
Really ?
I don 't know ?
I don 't know .
But don 't you worry about it , now .
Go to sleep , baby .
Go to sleep .
Close your pretty eyes and close your pretty lips
Oh , Holy Virgin ... by the pain ...
in which our Lord Jesus Christ ...
Bore the burden of our sins ... obtain for us by thy intecession the courage and strength
Follow in his footsteps and bear our cross until the end of our lives .
Amen .
What do you want ?
You 'll wake her up .
Get us a drink .
Oh , mommy .
Mommy , the telephone .
All right , baby .
Did you have a good sleep , angel ?
Yes , thank you .
Hello .
Oh , hello , Gus .
Good morning yourself .
Oh , is that all ?
Ok , we 'll meet the troupe at the station at three .
That was Gus Weinbaum from the booking office .
We open in Buffalo this week .
Better get up and get dressed , precious .
We gotta start packing .
Got a nice cold grapefruit for you and a swell breakfast .
Oh , good .
We open in Buffalo tomorrow .
Now Hitch , honey ...
Let 's settle our problems .
You and me , we can 't go on like we have with April here .
We gotta get married now .
Well , it 's up to you , Kitty .
It 's okay with me like I told ya , providing that kid of yours is put to work .
She will , honey , she is going to work , but not in show business .
I got other plans for her .
There you go again .
What else can she do , I 'm asking ya ?
I mean , here we are , jumping to Buffalo with that ... and from there , well , who knows ?
Now if she gets a job in New York that means she can 't travel with us .
So , are you planning on leaving her alone here ?
The kid 's got a real chance in burlesque .
Don 't you see that ?
She 's got youth , looks , the whole works .
She comes by it naturally .
I can make her one of the biggest bets in show business .
But she don 't wanna be in show business .
She said she hates it .
How does a kid like that know what she wants ?
Now listen , Kitty .
I 'm not gonna waste any more time arguing .
I 'm not gonna get married unless I 'm gonna be the boss .
And if I 'm gonna be the boss , I say the kid is going into show .
That 's final .
I don 't know .
Don 't be cross at me , Hitch .
I 'm trying to do the best all around .
If you think it 's the right thing to do ...
Why , sure it is , babes .
You go on in there and get her .
I 'll talk to her .
I 'll sell her the idea .
She 's getting the swellest break a kid ever got .
We 'll be one big happy family , huh ?
The three of us .
We 'll go to Buffalo or any other man 's place , huh ?
Come on , get her in here .
April !
April , baby .
Come here .
Mommy wants to talk to you .
Come here , baby .
Come to your daddy .
He 's gonna pour a million dollars in gold in your lap .
Here 's to the bride and groom .
How 's that ?
Rotten .
Now look , now .
Don 't !
What 's the matter ?
I don 't like to be mauled Too bad about you .
Maybe a good maui would do you good for a change .
This touch-me-not stuff is beginning to give me a pain in the neck .
What 's the idea of that ?
It 's too hot in here .
Yeah ?
Come on , let 's run through that tap routine .
All right .
What 's the matter with you ?
You 've been in the show eight months and you got about as much ambition as a Ziegfeld clothes horse .
Can 't you take a little interest in what I 'm trying to teach you ?
No .
I hate dance .
And I hate burlesque .
You don 't have to stay in burlesque .
Just give me a little cooperation I 'll make another Marilyn Miller out of you .
I 'm not interested .
Will you lay off that tone of voice ?
Here I am .
Trying to help you , trying to be your pal .
You treat me like I was an ashman or something .
Jeez , you get my goat !
Why don 't to let me alone .
Let you alone ?
Listen , what you need is to have somebody wake you up and make you be human .
I got a good mind to teach you a couple of tricks they 'd never learn you in a convent .
You won 't teach me anything .
Let go of my wrist .
I met babies like you before , Saint Cecilia .
There 's only one way to treat them and that 's rough .
There , that 's something to think about .
Oh , oh !
What 's going on here ?
It 's just that precious infant of yours getting temperamental again .
Don 't you two ever stop fighting ?
here I am , working like a dog trying to learn her the business .
Never mind .
What do you think that dirty little Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning ?
He said he ain 't gonna give me a contract for the new stock season ... till I 've been in the show for two weeks and he can see how I get by .
Not only that , he practically insists that I go with a bunch of the girls ... to a lousy stag smoker in the Bronx after the show tonight .
Can you beat that for a nerve ?
Me , Kitty Darling , dancing for a lot of drunk stags .
Well , what of it ?
The problem with you and that kid of yours is you 're both getting too high-hat .
Why , Hitchy .
What 's the matter with you , cookie ?
Oh , nothing .
You hadn 't oughta be fighting all the time .
I 'd like you 'd to try to be nice to him for a change .
Try to make him love you , cookie .
Make him love me ?
Yes , angel .
Make him love you .
For my sake .
This is a swell night to be going to a stag smoker .
Thought you were going to try to get me out of it .
Well , I argued with Gus but it didn 't do no good .
A good husband you are , letting Gus send your wife to shake for a mob Bronx gorillas .
On such a hot night .
Well , fifty bucks is fifty bucks .
Ready to go home , mommy ?
No , sweetness , I gotta go to that stag smoker .
Hitch couldn 't fix it for me with Gus .
I 'll see that you get home okay , April .
I gotta get going .
Come on , snooks , walk out to the door with me .
You wait outside for me , April .
She will .
Mommy , take me with you , please .
To a stag party ?
I should say not .
I 'll wait outside for you .
Till 3 or 4 o 'clock in the morning ?
You 're crazy .
Now you go back to the hotel .
I don 't want to go back to the hotel with Hitch .
Please , mommy , please .
The girls in the taxi are waiting for you , Miss Darling .
Thanks , Otto .
Now you stop fussing about Hitch .
Be a good girl .
Maybe he 'll buy you some chop suey .
I gotta tip him .
Mommy !
Oh , hey , I 've been waiting for you .
Oops !
Hello , kid .
Hey give us a kiss .
What 's your hurry , sister ?
Where are you going , baby ?
Wait a minute , sweetheart .
Come on , baby , give me a break .
Say , listen now , just ...
Say , who do you think you 're messing with ?
Stay away !
Hey , what 's this ?
Keep out of this .
She 's my girl .
I am not .
He 's following me .
On your way , guy , or I 'll poke a hole through that pant of yours .
You and Harmony Marines .
You Navy guys think you 're tough , don 't ya ?
They don 't come any tougher .
Got any other odd jobs for the Navy tonight ?
No , thank you so much .
Pretty late for a little girl like you to be wandering around by yourself .
Maybe I 'll have to stroll a little way with you .
Oh , please don 't bother .
Did you say " bother " ?
Hope you don 't think I 'm fresh walking along with you like this .
Not at all .
I hope you don 't think I 'm trying to follow you or anything .
Oh , no .
Live around here ?
No .
I come all the way from Wisconsin .
Why don 't you go back ?
Say , I think you 're trying to get rid of me .
How did you guess ?
Oh , I 'm clever that way .
What way ?
Oh , come on , be nice , won 't you ?
I 'm not a gorilla .
But I don 't know you .
Well , use your chance .
No , listen , here 's the idea .
Why not let 's stop somewhere and get something to eat ?
There 's no harm in that .
And if you don 't like the cut of my gib I 'll be on my way .
Well , that seems fair enough .
I always eat after the show anyway .
Now you 're talking .
Say , you 're nice .
You don 't look like a show girl .
Maybe I shouldn 't have mentioned it .
No kidding , I like you .
And I guess you 're not so bad yourself .
Come on , Wisconsin .
Boy , was I hungry .
Me too .
Gee , you don 't know how much I appreciate this .
No kidding .
I mean , I 've been cruising around town all evening ... up one street and down the other .
Just looking for somebody to talk to .
Sailors don 't generally have much trouble finding company .
Oh , I don 't want the kind of company you mean .
Listen , all sailors ain 't a bunch of bums .
But you got no idea how tough it is to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this .
Maybe I have .
Aw , a girl like you lonesome .
So , what 's your name , anyway ?
I 've been so excited about finding you I forgot to ask .
April .
April ?
No kidding ?
Sounds like a name out of a book .
I don 't know , though .
It sorta fits you .
Sounds sweet , sort of gentle .
Just like I bet you are .
Oh , you say the same thing to every girl you meet .
How could I ?
I never met a girl named April before .
What 's your name ?
Tony .
I don 't like it much .
Sounds like a white bootblack .
Oh , no , I think Tony 's a nice name .
You do ?
Tony and April .
Sounds nice together , eh ?
Gee , but your eyes are blue .
Eat your chocolate cake .
April .
April .
April .
Why the little ...
Hello , Ed ?
Did April come in yet ?
She didn 't ?
Are you sure ?
Thanks .
The little ...
Those big waves ...
Gosh , they look to be about as tall as the Woolworth building , pretty near .
They 'd come down over the bough , crash .
And the ship would shake like it was gonna split in two .
One big wave after the other .
Boy , all night we didn 't know if we was gonna weather it or not .
Well , anyway ... next morning the sun was shining the ocean was as smooth as glass .
And right up the starboard was the coast of China .
It must be wonderful to sail all over the world that way .
Oh , I don 't know .
You get tired of it just like anything else .
I got a week to make up my mind if I 'm gonna enlist again .
I suppose I will .
Sorry , pal .
Closing time .
But the park is still open .
Okay , skipper .
I had no idea it was so late .
Here you are .
Gee , I don 't want to lose you so soon .
Just when we were getting acquainted .
Can 't we find some other place ?
But it 's pretty late .
I know just the place .
It 's nice and cool too .
Where ?
Brooklyn Bridge .
Isn 't it beautiful ?
Yeah .
Sure is pretty .
Even Brooklyn looks pretty .
It must be awfully late .
What do you care ?
My mother will be worried .
I do have to sleep some time .
They have rehearsal at eleven .
Well , I won 't get much sleep tonight .
It 's too hot to sleep .
I mean , I 'll be thinking about you .
Look at that city over there .
Everybody sleeping .
Everybody dreaming .
And two people like us , on this bridge just as if we 've known each other all our lives .
It 's sort of like a dream too , isn 't it ?
Yeah .
Pretty soon the sun will come up and the people will wake up .
and even you and I will go right on the way we were before .
Just as if we 'd never met at all .
Say , don 't kid yourself .
I 'm gonna camp right on your doorstep the rest of the time I 'm on leave .
How long is that ?
Saturday .
This is Tuesday .
That makes four days .
And then you 'll forget all about me .
No , sir .
Never .
Yes , you will .
You 'll go sailing away from me , just like that boat down there will now .
A tanker going out with the tide .
Ships have to go out with the tide , don 't they ?
And sailors have to go with their ships .
And the world is full of other rivers and bridges with girls to sit on them till the tide goes out .
Oh , April , I 'm not like the rest of those gobs .
Sometimes I think there are people who were just meant to be lonesome .
You know , and then they 'll meet someone for a little while and it gives them something to remember .
So their lonesomeness doesn 't hurt so much for a while .
I don 't know how to say what I mean .
Yes , but if those people meet the right people they get together for keeps .
Then they ain 't lonesome anymore .
But the right people don 't seem to find each other very often .
Yeah , ain 't it the truth .
Well , Tony ...
Well ...
I 've got to go home .
I don 't want to , but I 've got to .
Right .
Let me help you down .
Good night .
Or rather , good morning .
Don 't forget tomorrow .
It 's a date .
I won 't .
I hope I 'm gonna live that long .
Just don 't stop breathing .
Looks like I just can 't let you go .
I 've really got to go now .
Well ...
Well ...
Good night .
Good night .
Good night , girls .
Go right home , now .
Leave that taxi driver alone .
Hello , sailor boy .
Hello , yourself .
What 's the rush , sailor boy ?
Well , young lady , where do you think you 've been ?
Is mommy in yet ?
Never mind .
Who 've you been out with until 5 o 'clock in the morning ?
None of your business .
A pickup , huh ?
A pickup just like every other cheap little burlesque dame .
I 'm not a cheap little burlesque dame .
No ?
Just an innocent kid from a convent , huh ?
Well get this through your head .
If you 're gonna start this stay-out-all-night stuff I 'm gonna have something to say about it myself .
Charity begins at home , baby .
Let me go !
Let me go ...
Well , what 's this ?
Hello , beautiful .
You 're just in time to witness the signing of the Peace Treaty .
While we was waiting for you we come to an understanding .
Everything 's jake now .
April April , is it true ?
Just one big happy family from now on .
Everything 's swell okay .
One big happy family , hooray !
Oooh , gee wiz , I gotta lie down ,
Gee .
Look at all those people down there .
Aren 't there a lot of people in the word , though ?
Only two as far as I 'm concerned .
Look .
Just look .
I 'd hate to fall .
If you did , I 'd fall right after you .
Wouldn 't that be silly ?
Look , the Woolworth Building .
Yeah .
That 's some sight , isn 't it ?
Oh , it 's wonderful .
You are wonderful .
Well , there 's the sea .
Yes .
Look at the old Statue of Liberty .
I bet if I stood here I could see your ship when it leaves tonight .
I should wave my handkerchief .
What are you laughing at ?
Well , April , I 'm not going back to my ship .
Why not ?
Well , I got an important date tomorrow .
Have you ?
Hm-hm .
And so have you .
We 're gonna be married .
Oh , I thought for a minute you were serious .
I am .
You 're gonna marry me ... and we 're going back to my home town in Wisconsin and graze wheat and have a Ford , a radio , well , and several things .
We are not .
Oh , yes we are .
You 're gonna marry me .
It 's all decided .
I decided it .
Did you ?
You better say yes .
I don 't see why .
Because if you don 't , I 'll jump right off this roof .
Oh , Tony !
Yes !
Aw , gee , I 'm happy .
Aren 't you ?
Yes .
What I know about sailors , they
But I believe everything you told me about yourself and your folks .
I think you 're on the level .
You bet I 'm on the level , Miss Darling .
You gotta be good to my little girl .
She 's just a baby .
Don 't worry about that .
She 'll love it out in the country .
My folks will be crazy about her .
Well , that 's that , I suppose .
I 'm glad .
I never wanted April to be in show business .
My baby angel .
What 's the next thing on the program ?
Why , I thought we all might all have dinner some place to celebrate .
Where ?
You gotta make it early .
I have a show .
How about that chop suey place we was at the other night ?
That 's fine .
Okay , about six ?
Great .
Well , I 'll be running along .
Goodbye for a little while , sweetheart .
Oh , excuse me .
You 're all right , son .
Was that the boyfreind we 've been hearing so much about I 've just run across in the hall ?
Mommy , I 'll go in and change my dress .
Wait a minute , I 'm talking to you .
This playing around with the Navy 's gotta stop .
Oh , let her alone .
She 's got a date with her fiancée .
Her what ?
The man she 's gonna marry .
Are you trying to kid me ?
No , April 's gonna be married .
You 're telling me you 're gonna allow April to marry some lousy gob ?
Oh , he 's all right .
I like him .
We had a long talk .
You had a long talk .
Well , how about consulting me once in a while ?
Oh , turn your dapper down .
Everything 's under control .
Oh , it is , is it ?
That 's what you say .
Now me just back from a two-hour session at the Keith Office getting our acts set .
What 's that got to do with April ?
Everything .
They want her to do it with me .
But that 's our act .
Yours and mine .
Well , it 's all been changed .
It 's April or the whole proposition 's cold .
They want a younger woman in the act , that 's all , luscious .
A younger woman ?
Yeah , they want it younger , like April .
She 's ideal .
A smile like hers is worth a million dollars .
She 's got a swell figure and a pair of legs that ...
Why , she 's got more sex-appeal than ...
For a dame you couldn 't stand the sight of a few days ago ... you seem to be taking a big interest in April and her sex-appeal .
Professionally , sure .
Yeah ?
I wanna see her get ahead .
I got our future in mind .
What about my future ?
Now , beautiful .
Beautiful my eye .
Listen , Hitch Nelson .
Nobody 's gonna do that act but me , see ?
I don 't know what you and the Keith Office got up your sleeve but nobody 's double-crossing Kitty Darling .
Oh , yeah ?
Well , I 'll show you how much I 'm double-crossing ya , wise girl .
You don 't have to know I spent the whole morning with Gus Weinbaum begging him to keep you in your own show .
What are you trying to give me now ?
Your two weeks is up tonight and Gus is all set to can ya .
You 're a dirty liar .
All right .
Phone Gus and find out for yourself .
Well , I 'm certainly going to call you on that one .
Bryant 9483 .
We 'll just have a little showdown around here .
It will suit me fine .
Hello , I want to speak to Gus Weinbaum .
This is Miss Darling .
Hello , Kitty ?
What 's on your mind ?
What 's this I hear about you not renewing my contract after the show tonight ?
Well , you haven 't got that quite right , Kitty .
The fact is I got Lou working on a book now ... called " The Boarding School Girls " .
And it 's gotta have somebody in it that 's young .
An ingenue lead , see ?
Ingenue lead ?
I know the stuff the boys there out front want ...
I don 't know why you shouldn 't write that book around me .
You 're not gonna be left out .
I got you down for a specialty number and a runway number ... so where do you get in to squawk ?
I 'm a liar , eh ?
I 'll show Gus where he gets off .
I 'll have a contract in my own terms in ten minutes .
Hello , girlie , get me Bryant 9400 .
Hello , I wanna speak to Dave Holtz .
I 'll show the dirty little ...
Hello , Dave .
This is Kitty Darling .
Say , Dave , I 'm closing with Parisian Flirts tonight .
How about grabbing yourself a real bet for your Summer Widows ?
Thought I 'd give you first crack instead of fooling around with other stuff .
Well , you better take him .
I got nothing for you .
Twenty managers killed in the rush .
I got plenty of friends in this town .
Ah , save your nickels , you may need them .
None of your wisecracks , Hitch Nelson .
It takes a wise girl to know when to quit and that 's no wisecrack .
Quit what ?
Show business .
Can 't you see you 're all washed out ?
Why , you ...
What have you got left to give 'em ?
You 've been in it for twenty years .
Why kid yourself ?
You ain 't kidding anybody else .
You mind your own business .
I 'm not letting any cheap comic tell me how to run my affairs .
Cheap comic , eh ?
If it hadn 't been for me telling you how to run your affairs you 'd have been through long ago .
You 're a joke .
You 're just a fat old woman .
Look at yourself in the mirror .
Look at that neck , look at them wrinkles .
You better get wise to yourself and figure out where the coffee and cake 's money is coming from next season .
Right in that room is your meal ticket from now on .
And you let her marry some dope from the Brooklyn Navy outright when you needed her most .
She 's gonna marry him too , if I have to buy a tin cup and sell pencils on Broadway .
Not after I have a talk with her tonight .
If you dare to open your trap to her tonight we 're through .
I 'm fired , eh ?
Well , you 're wrong .
I quit , see ?
So what do you think of that ?
I 'm sick of seeing you around here .
I guess I got everything out of you I want , babes .
I got plans and they don 't include any old blondes .
Get out !
Get out before I kill you .
See you in the show business , beautiful
Mommy , you look tired .
I am a little .
Maybe you 'd better rest a little for a while instead of coming to dinner with us .
I think I 'd better .
You two don 't want any old ladies along anyway .
You run along to your sailor boy .
Mommy .
Mommy .
Tell me , what 's the matter ?
Mommy , I 'm not going to be married .
I 'm never going to go away from you now .
You heard Hitch and me yelling at each other , is that it ?
Come on now , cookie .
Don 't go taking it that serious .
You know how Hitch and me are , always rowing about something .
He don 't mean what he says half the time .
By tomorrow we 'll both of us forget all about it ...
Everything 's okay .
Don 't let a thing like that get you down .
You run along now see your sailor boy .
Stop being that way .
No , mommy .
I 'm going to tell Tony I can 't marry him .
But you must marry him , snooks .
After all we talked over ?
I 'm counting on it .
You don 't know how much it means to me .
No , mommy .
I just can 't , that 's all .
Now you listen to me , young lady .
I 'm your ma , and I say you 're going right down to dinner and fix it up .
and there 'll be no more talk about it .
All right , mommy .
I 'll fix it up .
And when I come to the theater tonight I wanna be sure you 're gonna tell me everything 's okay .
It will be .
It will be .
Come on now , kitten .
You gotta do this .
And don 't worry about me .
I 'm not a black number yet .
I know , mommy .
Boy , that 's happy music .
Just for us .
Wanna dance ?
No .
Wish you didn 't have to work tonight .
We could go to Coney Island .
I don 't like Coney Island .
Aw , come on , you don 't .
You did the other night .
That was the other night .
What 's the matter with you , honey ?
Why ?
Nothing .
Oh , yes there is .
Come on , let 's have it .
Tony , I 'll tell you .
I don 't know how to say it , but ...
Tony , I don 't want to get married .
Say , don 't say things like that , I got a week heart .
Tony , I mean it .
I like you an awful lot and all that ... but I just can 't think of getting married right now .
What 's the matter , honey ?
What 's happened ?
Nothing .
I don 't think you 'll be able to understand , but ...
Being born on the stage and all well , getting married and leaving , it seems to be giving up everything .
You told me the other night you wanted to get out of the show business .
That 's how I thought I felt .
When I come right down to it , I just can 't , that 's all .
You 'll never know , Tony , what it feels like to be on the other side of those footlights .
and to hear them clap and clap for you .
It does something to a girl .
I don 't know what .
April , I don 't believe a word you 're saying .
Either you 're lying to me or else you 've just been kidding yourself .
Now , come on , let 's dance and forget about it .
I don 't want to dance .
I want you to get it through your head right now .
This is it , really .
Mother signed a new contract today for a new show .
And there 's a chance for me to go with her in a splendid part .
If I don 't take it I know I 'll be sorry all my life .
Then we 'll both be miserable .
But listen , honey .
That 's no life for you .
Well , I 'm not so sure that married life in some godforsaken farm is a life for me either .
After all , I 'm young .
People tell me I 'm pretty .
Here I 've got a big chance .
I might be a star .
Now , I ask you , Tony ... what girl wouldn 't grab at the chance to land on Broadway in a big show ?
None , I suppose .
Not since you 're locked to them .
Let 's pray it ended up with nothing to be locked with right now .
Tony , don 't look at me like that .
Makes me feel terrible .
I really think you 're an awfully sweet boy , but after all , when it comes to love , why , I 've only known you five days .
You think of jumping into something and giving up a whole career ...
Well , Tony , you ought to understand .
Sure .
I mean , we 'll still have lots of fun together .
Just the same .
Go to lots of parties .
Why , we might even still be engaged .
No .
I wouldn 't want to feel like I 'm tying you down .
Guess I 'd better go back to my ship .
You mean , enlist again ?
Yeah .
Sailing for the West Indies .
I 've always wanted to see the West Indies .
But you 'll come back .
Sure , some day .
What time is it ?
Eight o 'clock , almost .
I could just make it if I hurry .
Tony !
You 're angry with me .
I didn 't want you to be .
Tony , please try not to hate me .
Please try to understand .
This was the best way for us both .
I don 't hate you .
I just gotta hurry , that 's all .
You ought to be getting down to your show too , don 't you ?
I 'll walk to the subway with you .
It 's on my way .
You 'll be late .
I don 't care .
Check , please .
Seventh floor , mam .
Good night , Jim , I 'll see you in the morning .
Good night , honey .
Well , thanks for coming down with me , April .
Oh , that was all right .
Well , here 's my train .
Bye , April .
Bye , Tony .
Don 't cry , kid .
There 'll be another one along any minute .
Cheer up .
April !
April !
April !
April !
April !
Aw , be quiet !
Where 's April ?
Where 's April ?
Mother !
What 's the matter ?
Help me to my dressing room
Well I 'll be ...
Where did she get ?
Mother , you 're sick .
Don 't worry about me .
Is everything all right ?
Everything 's fine .
Are you gonna be married right away ?
No , I sent him back to his ship , ma .
What 's this you 're saying ?
You lie down , you 'll feel better .
Tell me , tell me .
Don 't worry , it 's all over .
I sent him away .
I guess it is jolly life on board .
It 's a good thing we found out in time .
Oh , nothing matters now but you , mommy .
We 'll always have each other .
Nothing 's ever going to separate us again .
Oh , my God .
What have you done ?
What have I done ?
Mommy , you 're not well .
My baby , my little baby .
Well , this is a swell time to be showing up for a Saturday night show .
What 's the matter with her ?
Drunk ?
Well , what if she is ?
Drunk as a fool , look at her lying there , the gin-soaked old ...
You let my mother alone !
You men make me sick .
You don 't care about anything as long as you can shove somebody on your filthy stage .
and make them shake for a bunch of gorillas .
Yeah ?
Well that talk don 't get me anywhere .
So far as I 'm concerned Kitty Darling 's finished .
Here I talk to Gus Weinbaum trying to keep her in the show here ... and look at her , blind , paralyzed , Saturday night with nobody to take her place .
I 'll take her place .
I 'll get out there and get those gorillas your money 's worth .
Now what do you think of that ?
Me take a chance on a dumb chorus girl to fill a specialty number ?
You 're crazy !
Listen , she ain 't so dumb .
I 've been rehearsing her for weeks .
She 's swell , I 'm telling ya .
Anyway ain 't it be better take a chance with the kid ?
Well , maybe it is .
Hop to it , kid .
But you 'd better be good .
Come on , baby , wake up .
Oh , I 'll be good all right .
I 'll get out and give them what they want .
I 'll show them , I 'll show them !
Now you 're talkin ' .
You get out of my way .
Well I 'll be ...
Come on , get out there and play again .
No !
Come on , get out there .
No !
Come on , girls , get out there .
Do something .
Go ahead , get onstage there ...
Come on , you get onstage too .
Tony !
Tony !
I came back because I thought , well , maybe ...
Take me away from this terrible place .
You mean it ?
I never want to be in the stage again .
You know , I had a hunch you weren 't telling me the truth .
Aw , come on , what 's it all about ?
It 's mother .
Tony , I can 't go away and leave her now .
She 's sick .
She needs a home .
Then let her come with us .
That 'll be swell .
Come on , let 's go in and talk to her .
I bet I can make her see it our way .
It would be wonderful if she would .
We 'll always be together , won 't we ?
Yes , honey .
All three of us .
All three of us .

How are you feeling now , Kitty ?
I 'm all right .
You lay down during the intermisson and I 'll give you a couple of shots .
I 'll lay down but I don 't want any shots .
Telegram for you , Kitty .
For God 's sake , give me .
Nothing serious , I hope , Kitty .
No , it 's nothing .
Kitty , Kitty .
There 's more .
The one and only .
Take it easy , boys .
Hey , boys , don 't forget .
At the conclusion of tonight 's performance ...
Hey , is there a doctor in the house ?
No foolin , boys .
Is there a doctor in the house ?
All right , What 's the answer to that ?
Is Dr. Leonard here ?
Is Dr. Leonard here ?
Leonard !
Leonard !
Doctor Leonard !
Doctor Leonard .
Doctor Leonard .
What do you want ?
Come backstage , doc .
Make it snappy .
Hey doc , how did you ever get away from the office ?
Right this way , doctor .
All of you on the other side of the stage .
I 'll take you to the dressing room .
Stay in your pallet .
No , no , right of center door .
That 's right .
Oh , I don 't get clothes .
Go on to your dressing-room , quick !
Something she ate ?
No , she hasn 't been feeling so good for a couple of days .
And then when we came off this number she got this telegram and passed out .
What 's it all about ?
It 's from her husband .
He got sent up for croaking a big bum with an itch for Kitty .
Eddie was a swell fellow .
But he didn 't belong to this racket .
Crazy about Kitty .
Jealous of everybody .
But that 's no way to be in the Burlesque game .
No , I guess not .
Gee , it 's tough on Kitty , though .
Will she be able to go on again tonight , doc ?
No , sir .
Nor for many an acts to come .
Send one of the boys across the street for my surgical bag , will you ?
Sure .
Is there anything very serious ?
No , not if we work fast .
Hey , you .
Come in here .
I 'll need you .
On stage everybody .
Step on it .
Come on , get on there .
Hurry up , Joe .
It 's your entrance .
Well , Maude Adams ?
How about getting out there and giving the cast a little of your time , eh ?
What 's the matter with you ?
You 're not getting out there ?
Kitty 's got a baby .
Well I 'll be .
She 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .
Oh , Kitty 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .
Kitty 's got a baby .
What ?
Oh , boy !
Come on in , boys and girls , we got company .
Gee , Kitty , the baby looks great .
Oh , isn 't it cute ?
It looks just like Kitty .
Oh , what a beautiful baby !
Watch that left foot there , precious .
That 's right .
That 's fine .
That 's momma 's big girl .
Come in .
Uncle Joe !
Well , how 's my best girl today ?
Fine .
Now , Kitty , I got good news .
Just came from Maxmount 's office
And you and the Highflying Company is all set .
Thirty weeks date , you open in Toledo .
Did you make it plain about my billing ?
Oh , yeah .
He came through without a squawk .
And as for you , Snoops , look what I got for you .
From one comic to another .
Mommy , look !
Oh , Joe , that 's swell .
Come on , little monkey , you run over there .
Try 'em on , see how they look .
Listen , Kitty , I 've been thinking a lot lately about you .
What you two need is a man like me to take care of you .
Kitty Darling don 't need any man to take care of her .
Ain 't she getting along pretty well without one now ?
If you 'd leave it to me I 'd buy a cosy little home some place for you , Nicky .
where she could grow up right .
A home for me , eh ?
You want lumps growing on me , I suppose .
No , Mr. King , I got plans .
I 'm headed straight for Broadway , the big time .
No foolin ' , Kitty .
The kid deserves a better break .
Why , this burlesque racket is no place for her .
I can take plenty care of her , thanks .
Yeah , I know .
But she 's getting to the age where she 's learning things whether you like it or not .
Why , last night I overheard her trying to tell the one that the girls brought back from the elf 's backyard .
Look .
Look .
You see what I mean ?
Yes , maybe you 're right .
But , Joe , what can I do ?
Listen , I got a cousin that 'll send your kid to a nice school in Wisconsin .
A convent .
Take April away from me ?
The Blessed Heart .
She said it was great .
Oh , no , Joe .
I couldn 't .
I couldn 't .
I 'd die .
It 's for her own good , Kitty .
Honest .
She 'd get an education .
Grow up at a nice place .
Not in some lousy burlesque theater .
No sleeper jumps and none of the small town johns hanging around at nights .
And there 'll be sisters there to teach her the word of God .
And she 'd grow up in a nice place , grow up to be a lady .
not a cheap little tot .
You want April to be a lady , don 't you ?
You bet she 's gonna be a lady .
I got plans for her .
Then you 'd better send her to that convent .
Maybe I will .
Maybe I will .
Let us contemplate in its mystery how our Lord , Jesus Christ being sentenced to die bore with great patience the cross which was laid upon him for his greater torment and ignominy .
And now , April , there 's a little prayer that goes with this , dear .
It goes like this .
Oh , Holy Virgin , example of patience .
by the most painful carrying of the cross on which thy son , our Lord Jesus Christ , bore the heavy weight of our sins , obtain for us of Him , by thy intersession , courage and strength to follow His steps
And bear our cross after Him to the end of our lives ,
Amen .
I know he loves me , heaven knows why
And when he tells me he can 't live without me what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
He 's not an angel or saint ,
I know he loves me , heaven knows why and when he tells me he can 't live without me what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
I 'll never leave him alone , I 'll make his troubles my own
With all his faults I know we 'll get by
I 'm just no good when his arms are about me what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
what wouldn 't I do for that man ?
Give me air .
After that one I 'd better get out of here while I 'm still alive .
Come on , Hitch , stick around .
It 's early .
I can 't , Peggy .
Honest .
Kitty 'll be sore .
Anybody 'd think she got a mortgage on you .
You see that rock ?
As long as she keeps kicking in with little love tokens like that , sweetness ,
I 'm gonna keep right on being her wide-bedded boy .
Okay , big boy .
As long as she doesn 't get wise that you 're giving the runaround with every dame in the coop .
When she does , I 'll get me a new mama , peaches .
And your name 's right on top of the list .
Aw , baloney .
I loved that man from the start and way down deep in my heart
I know he loves me , heaven knows why and when he tells me he can 't live without me
What wouldn 't I do ...
Hello , beautiful !
Gee , you gave me a start .
Ain 't you home early ?
Well , I dumped the gang , luscious .
Had to come home to my big blonde mama .
Oh , honey .
My own sweet boy .
What 's all that stuff ?
Forget-me-nots ?
Just a lot of old letters and junk .
Hey , what john wrote your loads ?
You ain 't the first good-looking guy in my life .
But the last , eh ?
Who 's the dame ?
Give me that .
Wait a minute , can 't you ?
What 's the rush ?
Cute kid .
Sister ?
To my own darling mama .
Give me that .
Hey !
What 's that mean " To my own darling mama " , eh ?
You can read , can 't you ?
You mean to tell me this kid 's yours ?
Well , is it ?
Well , what if she is ?
You 've been holding out on me .
Shut up .
You 're all alike .
Just a lot of dirty double-crossing broads .
How old is the kid ?
Seventeen .
Where 's she at ?
In school .
In a convent .
That 's a laugh .
What for ?
I got plans for her .
I want her to have an education .
Yeah , but I always thought those joints were so expensive .
I manage to round up a coin every month .
So that 's where all your spare cash goes .
No wonder you didn 't have 100 bucks to loan me Monday .
But when I do have it to loan , what do you do with it ?
Drop it in some bookie 's lap .
Well , I 'm not thinking of myself so much now , see ?
But you oughta be sore if I go away .
Sure , you got a great career .
But it takes plenty of jack as well as talent to make the grade .
I got plenty of both , I guess .
Speaking of that , how about that act of ours you said the Keith Office was interested in ?
There you are , you see ?
That 's gonna cost about $ 1200 to mount .
Classy looking props , three changes for you , orchestrations and I 'll bet you ain 't got $ 1200 .
Maybe not .
But you said you 'd help , remember ?
Now , that ring I gave you .
I knew that was coming .
Hawk it , eh ?
That 's all the sentiment you got in ya .
Hawk that new overcoat you got me too , I suppose .
No , I want you to look nice .
Yeah , well ...
I guess I 'm gonna be the little old excess baggage around here from now on .
I can see you 've been playing me for a sucker .
Just a goodtime pal to keep you from getting lonesome on sleeper-jumps .
I 've been nuts about you .
But I 'm wise now .
Hitch , what are you driving at ?
I guess I got sense enough to know when I 'm through .
You 're not walking out on me ?
What do you expect me to do after the deal you 've given me ?
What deal , honey , what are you talking about ?
When we made our bargain it was gonna be 50 / 50 and no holding out on each other , right ?
Now what ?
I find out you got a kid seventeen and you 've been blowing your dough up .
Dough we need for ourselves , for our future , for your career .
What can I do , she 's my daughter , ain 't she ?
I 'll tell you what you can do .
You don 't have to keep her in some expensive dump like that , do you ?
Now get the kid down here .
Take her out of school ?
Make her go to work .
She 's old enough .
I wanna keep my baby out of show business .
Okay , Kitty , that 's my answer .
Wait a second .
Give me time to think .
There ain 't nothing to think about .
It 's her or me .
That 's flat .
All right , if you think that 's the right thing to do .
Why , sure it is , babes .
It 's time you did something for yourself instead of dishing out the gravy for someone else like you do .
One thing no , Hitch .
She ain 't going in to show business .
I 'll get her a job outside some place .
Okay , Kitty , just so long as she holds up our own name .
Now you sit right down here and write her a little letter .
Now , Hitch , don 't be cross at me , but don 't you think we oughta think this over a little ?
Honest , the way you rush me into things sometimes ...
Will you just stop fussing and write to her ?
You 've been saving and scrimping all your life to keep this jane in school .
Now it 's her turn to do something for you .
Help you put away a little money for a rainy day , right ?
Oh , I don 't know ...
You got a great career , babes .
She oughta be proud to help you , proud to be Kitty Darling 's daughter , right ?
Why , I know so .
She ain 't as good looking as her ma ... maybe she takes after her old man .
Instead you can depend on me , Kitty baby , to treat her right for your sake .
Why , we 'll just be one big happy family .
One big happy family .
May God 's love and kindness guide you .
As you go forth into the great world outside these gates ... and keep you from all harm till we meet again .
That is my prayer for you .
Little angel .
Goodbye .
Looking for somebody , honey ?
Yes , I ...

I 'm supposed to meet my mother here , Miss Darling .
Oh , so you 're Kitty Darling 's little girl , eh ?
Well , I 'm a couple of cockeyed sewing sewers .
My name 's Eddy Vermont .
I 'm in the merry-merry too .
One of your momma 's best pals .
Put it back here .
How do you do , Mr. Vermont ?
Your ma is up at the theater .
She wants you to wait upstairs till she gets back .
Oh , how long will I have to wait to see her ?
Not more than an hour or so .
These uptown grind joints get out early .
I 'll show you to the rooms .
Thank you .
You got a great ma , Miss Darling .
And believe me , she sure knows her stuff .
That Swedish movement of hers has been laying 'em in the aisles ever since I was a pup .
Swedish movement ?
I mean the way Kitty slams over her number .
And boy , she packs the meanest strip and teaser routine that ever burned a Verona way .
You know what I mean .
Not exactly .
I haven 't seen my mother on the stage since I was five .
No ?
But I remember she was wonderful .
I 'll say so .
Say , I got a bright idea .
Instead of hanging around this dump , why don 't you grab the Lexington Ave .
local and go up and catch the show ?
Do you really think I could ?
Sure .
I can 't take you myself , I have a heavy date .
But my kid brother , Slim , he 'll take you .
He 's a nice guy , too .
Okay with you ?
Yes .
All right , I 'll get him right down .
512 , sweetheart .
Slim ?
Come right down .
I got a job for you .
Yeah , yeah .
Sorry the seats ain 't so hot but the show 's almost over .
Sit down !
What are you looking at , punk ?
We oughta pension off that faded old blonde .
Yeah , she 's all worked up anyway , look at that .
Let 's go away from here , please .
Okay , I 'll take you back to your ma .
All right .
All right , tag along this side .
Mommy !
April , baby !
I don 't know whether I done right bringing her up here , Kitty .
but she was all harped up in seeing you .
We thought it would be a nice surprise .
It sure was , you did just right .
Oh , my , look at this girl ...
Well , guess I 'll be edging along .
So long everybody .
Bye .
You look like an old lady .
Oh , mother , mommy !
Oh , dear .
You 're so pretty .
Ain 't she , Hitch ?
Yes .
Oh , this is Hitch Nelson .
He 's the Hitch I 've been writing you about .
How do you do , Mr. Nelson ?
Make it Hitch , kid .
We 're all pals together .
What do you think of my great big girl .
A litttle skinny .
Ah , Hitchy .
Ain 't he a lemon , though ?
Honest , the things he says to people I meet .
He 's a bad one .
He don 't mean nothing by it .
Now you sit down here .
Say , you better finish your change , beautiful .
You only got a couple of minutes .
Yeah , that 's right .
If I had known I could have company like this I ... oooh !
like this , well ...
Angel baby , just as soon as we get out of this joint we 'll go down to Gialetta 's and we 'll sit on the swellest place you ever saw and stuff ourselves flat in the face .
Up short , Kitty .
All right , all right .
Come on , watch me finish the show .
I 'd rather stay here if you don 't mind .
All right for you then .
Kick 'er up , honey .
Got any ideas about going into show business ?
No .
Why not ?
Don 't you like it ?
No .
You 're a funny kid .
Oh , don 't jump .
I ain 't gonna bite .
Did you hear that ?
Suppose that was for you , huh ?
Everybody in the whole damn house clapping and yelling .
Going nuts about ya .
Nice ?
No ?
Why not ?
You 're a funny kid .
Just a little bit goofy .
But that 's what comes from not knowing what it 's all about .
Please , Mr. Nelson .
Didn 't I ask you to call me Hitch ?
I wanna be your pal , see ?
And if you listen to me you 'll let me learn you a couple of dance routines to put you in the show .
No , thank you .
I 'm pretty sure I don 't want to be in the show .
But you 've got the makings of a great artist .
With your looks and my training it 's Broadway for you , no foolin ' .
You take the word of an old cue man .
That 's the finale .
Gotta go .
Seeya later , kid .
... and give your baby nights a lovin ' ...
Open up your eyes and open up your lips
Why don 't you try to get some sleep , precious ?
I can 't .
You oughta be plenty tired after your trip and all .
Oh , I 'm tired enough but ...
I don 't know .
I feel funny .
All mixed up inside .
Why , precious .
What 's the matter ?
Tell mother what 's the matter .
Everything is so different from what I thought it would be .
Sure .
You ain 't in a convent anymore .
But ain 't you glad to be back with me again ?
Yes , mommy darling , but ...
I don 't know how to describe it .
But New York 's too big , dirty and noisy .
And your theater with all those men ... and the girls with no clothes on .
Oh , I suppose it does seem queer to you .
Coming from a place where they cover everything but their noses .
But things ain 't as bad as that .
It ain 't what you do so much .
It 's what you are .
That 's it .
It 's what you are .
Why there 's a couple of dames in this troupe good at things you 'd never expect to see , even if they do make their living shaking .
I ain 't ashamed of it .
You shouldn 't be ashamed of me neither .
Oh , mommy , I 'm not ashamed of you .
Let me tell you something , April , baby .
If it wasn 't for the dough I 've been piling up that way in the last 10 or 12 years you would never have been to no convent .
I know .
I know .
That 's what I 've been thinking .
I 'm just beginning to realize that .
All these things you 've gone through and I never knew .
Dancing with those girls .
Horrible men staring at you .
Saying awful things .
Now don 't you think I 'm going to be in this burlesque racket all my life neither .
Just one more season with my name on Broadway in lights .
And the big dough .
Then we 'll have a nice little home .
And we 'll be together and be happy .
Oh , mommy .
You 've done so much to make me happy .
From now on I 'll try and make you just as happy .
Oh , I ain 't done nothing .
But we 've got each other from now on and it 's gonna be for always .
Yes , for always .
And we 'll be so happy together .
Just you and I.
You said it .
After all , snooks , things can 't be all bad as long as we got each other .
Don 't you forget that .
Now you go to sleep , now .
Close your pretty eyes and close your pretty lips and give your baby nights a loving ...
Mommy , about Mr. Nelson
What about him ?
I don 't think he likes me .
Aw , he 's crazy about you .
Why , he said so .
Are you going to be married ?
Really ?
I don 't know ?
I don 't know .
But don 't you worry about it , now .
Go to sleep , baby .
Go to sleep .
Close your pretty eyes and close your pretty lips
Oh , Holy Virgin ... by the pain ...
in which our Lord Jesus Christ ...
Bore the burden of our sins ... obtain for us by thy intecession the courage and strength
Follow in his footsteps and bear our cross until the end of our lives .
Amen .
What do you want ?
You 'll wake her up .
Get us a drink .
Oh , mommy .
Mommy , the telephone .
All right , baby .
Did you have a good sleep , angel ?
Yes , thank you .
Hello .
Oh , hello , Gus .
Good morning yourself .
Oh , is that all ?
Ok , we 'll meet the troupe at the station at three .
That was Gus Weinbaum from the booking office .
We open in Buffalo this week .
Better get up and get dressed , precious .
We gotta start packing .
Got a nice cold grapefruit for you and a swell breakfast .
Oh , good .
We open in Buffalo tomorrow .
Now Hitch , honey ...
Let 's settle our problems .
You and me , we can 't go on like we have with April here .
We gotta get married now .
Well , it 's up to you , Kitty .
It 's okay with me like I told ya , providing that kid of yours is put to work .
She will , honey , she is going to work , but not in show business .
I got other plans for her .
There you go again .
What else can she do , I 'm asking ya ?
I mean , here we are , jumping to Buffalo with that ... and from there , well , who knows ?
Now if she gets a job in New York that means she can 't travel with us .
So , are you planning on leaving her alone here ?
The kid 's got a real chance in burlesque .
Don 't you see that ?
She 's got youth , looks , the whole works .
She comes by it naturally .
I can make her one of the biggest bets in show business .
But she don 't wanna be in show business .
She said she hates it .
How does a kid like that know what she wants ?
Now listen , Kitty .
I 'm not gonna waste any more time arguing .
I 'm not gonna get married unless I 'm gonna be the boss .
And if I 'm gonna be the boss , I say the kid is going into show .
That 's final .
I don 't know .
Don 't be cross at me , Hitch .
I 'm trying to do the best all around .
If you think it 's the right thing to do ...
Why , sure it is , babes .
You go on in there and get her .
I 'll talk to her .
I 'll sell her the idea .
She 's getting the swellest break a kid ever got .
We 'll be one big happy family , huh ?
The three of us .
We 'll go to Buffalo or any other man 's place , huh ?
Come on , get her in here .
April !
April , baby .
Come here .
Mommy wants to talk to you .
Come here , baby .
Come to your daddy .
He 's gonna pour a million dollars in gold in your lap .
Here 's to the bride and groom .
How 's that ?
Rotten .
Now look , now .
Don 't !
What 's the matter ?
I don 't like to be mauled Too bad about you .
Maybe a good maui would do you good for a change .
This touch-me-not stuff is beginning to give me a pain in the neck .
What 's the idea of that ?
It 's too hot in here .
Yeah ?
Come on , let 's run through that tap routine .
All right .
What 's the matter with you ?
You 've been in the show eight months and you got about as much ambition as a Ziegfeld clothes horse .
Can 't you take a little interest in what I 'm trying to teach you ?
No .
I hate dance .
And I hate burlesque .
You don 't have to stay in burlesque .
Just give me a little cooperation I 'll make another Marilyn Miller out of you .
I 'm not interested .
Will you lay off that tone of voice ?
Here I am .
Trying to help you , trying to be your pal .
You treat me like I was an ashman or something .
Jeez , you get my goat !
Why don 't to let me alone .
Let you alone ?
Listen , what you need is to have somebody wake you up and make you be human .
I got a good mind to teach you a couple of tricks they 'd never learn you in a convent .
You won 't teach me anything .
Let go of my wrist .
I met babies like you before , Saint Cecilia .
There 's only one way to treat them and that 's rough .
There , that 's something to think about .
Oh , oh !
What 's going on here ?
It 's just that precious infant of yours getting temperamental again .
Don 't you two ever stop fighting ?
here I am , working like a dog trying to learn her the business .
Never mind .
What do you think that dirty little Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning ?
He said he ain 't gonna give me a contract for the new stock season ... till I 've been in the show for two weeks and he can see how I get by .
Not only that , he practically insists that I go with a bunch of the girls ... to a lousy stag smoker in the Bronx after the show tonight .
Can you beat that for a nerve ?
Me , Kitty Darling , dancing for a lot of drunk stags .
Well , what of it ?
The problem with you and that kid of yours is you 're both getting too high-hat .
Why , Hitchy .
What 's the matter with you , cookie ?
Oh , nothing .
You hadn 't oughta be fighting all the time .
I 'd like you 'd to try to be nice to him for a change .
Try to make him love you , cookie .
Make him love me ?
Yes , angel .
Make him love you .
For my sake .
This is a swell night to be going to a stag smoker .
Thought you were going to try to get me out of it .
Well , I argued with Gus but it didn 't do no good .
A good husband you are , letting Gus send your wife to shake for a mob Bronx gorillas .
On such a hot night .
Well , fifty bucks is fifty bucks .
Ready to go home , mommy ?
No , sweetness , I gotta go to that stag smoker .
Hitch couldn 't fix it for me with Gus .
I 'll see that you get home okay , April .
I gotta get going .
Come on , snooks , walk out to the door with me .
You wait outside for me , April .
She will .
Mommy , take me with you , please .
To a stag party ?
I should say not .
I 'll wait outside for you .
Till 3 or 4 o 'clock in the morning ?
You 're crazy .
Now you go back to the hotel .
I don 't want to go back to the hotel with Hitch .
Please , mommy , please .
The girls in the taxi are waiting for you , Miss Darling .
Thanks , Otto .
Now you stop fussing about Hitch .
Be a good girl .
Maybe he 'll buy you some chop suey .
I gotta tip him .
Mommy !
Oh , hey , I 've been waiting for you .
Oops !
Hello , kid .
Hey give us a kiss .
What 's your hurry , sister ?
Where are you going , baby ?
Wait a minute , sweetheart .
Come on , baby , give me a break .
Say , listen now , just ...
Say , who do you think you 're messing with ?
Stay away !
Hey , what 's this ?
Keep out of this .
She 's my girl .
I am not .
He 's following me .
On your way , guy , or I 'll poke a hole through that pant of yours .
You and Harmony Marines .
You Navy guys think you 're tough , don 't ya ?
They don 't come any tougher .
Got any other odd jobs for the Navy tonight ?
No , thank you so much .
Pretty late for a little girl like you to be wandering around by yourself .
Maybe I 'll have to stroll a little way with you .
Oh , please don 't bother .
Did you say " bother " ?
Hope you don 't think I 'm fresh walking along with you like this .
Not at all .
I hope you don 't think I 'm trying to follow you or anything .
Oh , no .
Live around here ?
No .
I come all the way from Wisconsin .
Why don 't you go back ?
Say , I think you 're trying to get rid of me .
How did you guess ?
Oh , I 'm clever that way .
What way ?
Oh , come on , be nice , won 't you ?
I 'm not a gorilla .
But I don 't know you .
Well , use your chance .
No , listen , here 's the idea .
Why not let 's stop somewhere and get something to eat ?
There 's no harm in that .
And if you don 't like the cut of my gib I 'll be on my way .
Well , that seems fair enough .
I always eat after the show anyway .
Now you 're talking .
Say , you 're nice .
You don 't look like a show girl .
Maybe I shouldn 't have mentioned it .
No kidding , I like you .
And I guess you 're not so bad yourself .
Come on , Wisconsin .
Boy , was I hungry .
Me too .
Gee , you don 't know how much I appreciate this .
No kidding .
I mean , I 've been cruising around town all evening ... up one street and down the other .
Just looking for somebody to talk to .
Sailors don 't generally have much trouble finding company .
Oh , I don 't want the kind of company you mean .
Listen , all sailors ain 't a bunch of bums .
But you got no idea how tough it is to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this .
Maybe I have .
Aw , a girl like you lonesome .
So , what 's your name , anyway ?
I 've been so excited about finding you I forgot to ask .
April .
April ?
No kidding ?
Sounds like a name out of a book .
I don 't know , though .
It sorta fits you .
Sounds sweet , sort of gentle .
Just like I bet you are .
Oh , you say the same thing to every girl you meet .
How could I ?
I never met a girl named April before .
What 's your name ?
Tony .
I don 't like it much .
Sounds like a white bootblack .
Oh , no , I think Tony 's a nice name .
You do ?
Tony and April .
Sounds nice together , eh ?
Gee , but your eyes are blue .
Eat your chocolate cake .
April .
April .
April .
Why the little ...
Hello , Ed ?
Did April come in yet ?
She didn 't ?
Are you sure ?
Thanks .
The little ...
Those big waves ...
Gosh , they look to be about as tall as the Woolworth building , pretty near .
They 'd come down over the bough , crash .
And the ship would shake like it was gonna split in two .
One big wave after the other .
Boy , all night we didn 't know if we was gonna weather it or not .
Well , anyway ... next morning the sun was shining the ocean was as smooth as glass .
And right up the starboard was the coast of China .
It must be wonderful to sail all over the world that way .
Oh , I don 't know .
You get tired of it just like anything else .
I got a week to make up my mind if I 'm gonna enlist again .
I suppose I will .
Sorry , pal .
Closing time .
But the park is still open .
Okay , skipper .
I had no idea it was so late .
Here you are .
Gee , I don 't want to lose you so soon .
Just when we were getting acquainted .
Can 't we find some other place ?
But it 's pretty late .
I know just the place .
It 's nice and cool too .
Where ?
Brooklyn Bridge .
Isn 't it beautiful ?
Yeah .
Sure is pretty .
Even Brooklyn looks pretty .
It must be awfully late .
What do you care ?
My mother will be worried .
I do have to sleep some time .
They have rehearsal at eleven .
Well , I won 't get much sleep tonight .
It 's too hot to sleep .
I mean , I 'll be thinking about you .
Look at that city over there .
Everybody sleeping .
Everybody dreaming .
And two people like us , on this bridge just as if we 've known each other all our lives .
It 's sort of like a dream too , isn 't it ?
Yeah .
Pretty soon the sun will come up and the people will wake up .
and even you and I will go right on the way we were before .
Just as if we 'd never met at all .
Say , don 't kid yourself .
I 'm gonna camp right on your doorstep the rest of the time I 'm on leave .
How long is that ?
Saturday .
This is Tuesday .
That makes four days .
And then you 'll forget all about me .
No , sir .
Never .
Yes , you will .
You 'll go sailing away from me , just like that boat down there will now .
A tanker going out with the tide .
Ships have to go out with the tide , don 't they ?
And sailors have to go with their ships .
And the world is full of other rivers and bridges with girls to sit on them till the tide goes out .
Oh , April , I 'm not like the rest of those gobs .
Sometimes I think there are people who were just meant to be lonesome .
You know , and then they 'll meet someone for a little while and it gives them something to remember .
So their lonesomeness doesn 't hurt so much for a while .
I don 't know how to say what I mean .
Yes , but if those people meet the right people they get together for keeps .
Then they ain 't lonesome anymore .
But the right people don 't seem to find each other very often .
Yeah , ain 't it the truth .
Well , Tony ...
Well ...
I 've got to go home .
I don 't want to , but I 've got to .
Right .
Let me help you down .
Good night .
Or rather , good morning .
Don 't forget tomorrow .
It 's a date .
I won 't .
I hope I 'm gonna live that long .
Just don 't stop breathing .
Looks like I just can 't let you go .
I 've really got to go now .
Well ...
Well ...
Good night .
Good night .
Good night , girls .
Go right home , now .
Leave that taxi driver alone .
Hello , sailor boy .
Hello , yourself .
What 's the rush , sailor boy ?
Well , young lady , where do you think you 've been ?
Is mommy in yet ?
Never mind .
Who 've you been out with until 5 o 'clock in the morning ?
None of your business .
A pickup , huh ?
A pickup just like every other cheap little burlesque dame .
I 'm not a cheap little burlesque dame .
No ?
Just an innocent kid from a convent , huh ?
Well get this through your head .
If you 're gonna start this stay-out-all-night stuff I 'm gonna have something to say about it myself .
Charity begins at home , baby .
Let me go !
Let me go ...
Well , what 's this ?
Hello , beautiful .
You 're just in time to witness the signing of the Peace Treaty .
While we was waiting for you we come to an understanding .
Everything 's jake now .
April April , is it true ?
Just one big happy family from now on .
Everything 's swell okay .
One big happy family , hooray !
Oooh , gee wiz , I gotta lie down ,
Gee .
Look at all those people down there .
Aren 't there a lot of people in the word , though ?
Only two as far as I 'm concerned .
Look .
Just look .
I 'd hate to fall .
If you did , I 'd fall right after you .
Wouldn 't that be silly ?
Look , the Woolworth Building .
Yeah .
That 's some sight , isn 't it ?
Oh , it 's wonderful .
You are wonderful .
Well , there 's the sea .
Yes .
Look at the old Statue of Liberty .
I bet if I stood here I could see your ship when it leaves tonight .
I should wave my handkerchief .
What are you laughing at ?
Well , April , I 'm not going back to my ship .
Why not ?
Well , I got an important date tomorrow .
Have you ?
Hm-hm .
And so have you .
We 're gonna be married .
Oh , I thought for a minute you were serious .
I am .
You 're gonna marry me ... and we 're going back to my home town in Wisconsin and graze wheat and have a Ford , a radio , well , and several things .
We are not .
Oh , yes we are .
You 're gonna marry me .
It 's all decided .
I decided it .
Did you ?
You better say yes .
I don 't see why .
Because if you don 't , I 'll jump right off this roof .
Oh , Tony !
Yes !
Aw , gee , I 'm happy .
Aren 't you ?
Yes .
What I know about sailors , they
But I believe everything you told me about yourself and your folks .
I think you 're on the level .
You bet I 'm on the level , Miss Darling .
You gotta be good to my little girl .
She 's just a baby .
Don 't worry about that .
She 'll love it out in the country .
My folks will be crazy about her .
Well , that 's that , I suppose .
I 'm glad .
I never wanted April to be in show business .
My baby angel .
What 's the next thing on the program ?
Why , I thought we all might all have dinner some place to celebrate .
Where ?
You gotta make it early .
I have a show .
How about that chop suey place we was at the other night ?
That 's fine .
Okay , about six ?
Great .
Well , I 'll be running along .
Goodbye for a little while , sweetheart .
Oh , excuse me .
You 're all right , son .
Was that the boyfreind we 've been hearing so much about I 've just run across in the hall ?
Mommy , I 'll go in and change my dress .
Wait a minute , I 'm talking to you .
This playing around with the Navy 's gotta stop .
Oh , let her alone .
She 's got a date with her fiancée .
Her what ?
The man she 's gonna marry .
Are you trying to kid me ?
No , April 's gonna be married .
You 're telling me you 're gonna allow April to marry some lousy gob ?
Oh , he 's all right .
I like him .
We had a long talk .
You had a long talk .
Well , how about consulting me once in a while ?
Oh , turn your dapper down .
Everything 's under control .
Oh , it is , is it ?
That 's what you say .
Now me just back from a two-hour session at the Keith Office getting our acts set .
What 's that got to do with April ?
Everything .
They want her to do it with me .
But that 's our act .
Yours and mine .
Well , it 's all been changed .
It 's April or the whole proposition 's cold .
They want a younger woman in the act , that 's all , luscious .
A younger woman ?
Yeah , they want it younger , like April .
She 's ideal .
A smile like hers is worth a million dollars .
She 's got a swell figure and a pair of legs that ...
Why , she 's got more sex-appeal than ...
For a dame you couldn 't stand the sight of a few days ago ... you seem to be taking a big interest in April and her sex-appeal .
Professionally , sure .
Yeah ?
I wanna see her get ahead .
I got our future in mind .
What about my future ?
Now , beautiful .
Beautiful my eye .
Listen , Hitch Nelson .
Nobody 's gonna do that act but me , see ?
I don 't know what you and the Keith Office got up your sleeve but nobody 's double-crossing Kitty Darling .
Oh , yeah ?
Well , I 'll show you how much I 'm double-crossing ya , wise girl .
You don 't have to know I spent the whole morning with Gus Weinbaum begging him to keep you in your own show .
What are you trying to give me now ?
Your two weeks is up tonight and Gus is all set to can ya .
You 're a dirty liar .
All right .
Phone Gus and find out for yourself .
Well , I 'm certainly going to call you on that one .
Bryant 9483 .
We 'll just have a little showdown around here .
It will suit me fine .
Hello , I want to speak to Gus Weinbaum .
This is Miss Darling .
Hello , Kitty ?
What 's on your mind ?
What 's this I hear about you not renewing my contract after the show tonight ?
Well , you haven 't got that quite right , Kitty .
The fact is I got Lou working on a book now ... called " The Boarding School Girls " .
And it 's gotta have somebody in it that 's young .
An ingenue lead , see ?
Ingenue lead ?
I know the stuff the boys there out front want ...
I don 't know why you shouldn 't write that book around me .
You 're not gonna be left out .
I got you down for a specialty number and a runway number ... so where do you get in to squawk ?
I 'm a liar , eh ?
I 'll show Gus where he gets off .
I 'll have a contract in my own terms in ten minutes .
Hello , girlie , get me Bryant 9400 .
Hello , I wanna speak to Dave Holtz .
I 'll show the dirty little ...
Hello , Dave .
This is Kitty Darling .
Say , Dave , I 'm closing with Parisian Flirts tonight .
How about grabbing yourself a real bet for your Summer Widows ?
Thought I 'd give you first crack instead of fooling around with other stuff .
Well , you better take him .
I got nothing for you .
Twenty managers killed in the rush .
I got plenty of friends in this town .
Ah , save your nickels , you may need them .
None of your wisecracks , Hitch Nelson .
It takes a wise girl to know when to quit and that 's no wisecrack .
Quit what ?
Show business .
Can 't you see you 're all washed out ?
Why , you ...
What have you got left to give 'em ?
You 've been in it for twenty years .
Why kid yourself ?
You ain 't kidding anybody else .
You mind your own business .
I 'm not letting any cheap comic tell me how to run my affairs .
Cheap comic , eh ?
If it hadn 't been for me telling you how to run your affairs you 'd have been through long ago .
You 're a joke .
You 're just a fat old woman .
Look at yourself in the mirror .
Look at that neck , look at them wrinkles .
You better get wise to yourself and figure out where the coffee and cake 's money is coming from next season .
Right in that room is your meal ticket from now on .
And you let her marry some dope from the Brooklyn Navy outright when you needed her most .
She 's gonna marry him too , if I have to buy a tin cup and sell pencils on Broadway .
Not after I have a talk with her tonight .
If you dare to open your trap to her tonight we 're through .
I 'm fired , eh ?
Well , you 're wrong .
I quit , see ?
So what do you think of that ?
I 'm sick of seeing you around here .
I guess I got everything out of you I want , babes .
I got plans and they don 't include any old blondes .
Get out !
Get out before I kill you .
See you in the show business , beautiful
Mommy , you look tired .
I am a little .
Maybe you 'd better rest a little for a while instead of coming to dinner with us .
I think I 'd better .
You two don 't want any old ladies along anyway .
You run along to your sailor boy .
Mommy .
Mommy .
Tell me , what 's the matter ?
Mommy , I 'm not going to be married .
I 'm never going to go away from you now .
You heard Hitch and me yelling at each other , is that it ?
Come on now , cookie .
Don 't go taking it that serious .
You know how Hitch and me are , always rowing about something .
He don 't mean what he says half the time .
By tomorrow we 'll both of us forget all about it ...
Everything 's okay .
Don 't let a thing like that get you down .
You run along now see your sailor boy .
Stop being that way .
No , mommy .
I 'm going to tell Tony I can 't marry him .
But you must marry him , snooks .
After all we talked over ?
I 'm counting on it .
You don 't know how much it means to me .
No , mommy .
I just can 't , that 's all .
Now you listen to me , young lady .
I 'm your ma , and I say you 're going right down to dinner and fix it up .
and there 'll be no more talk about it .
All right , mommy .
I 'll fix it up .
And when I come to the theater tonight I wanna be sure you 're gonna tell me everything 's okay .
It will be .
It will be .
Come on now , kitten .
You gotta do this .
And don 't worry about me .
I 'm not a black number yet .
I know , mommy .
Boy , that 's happy music .
Just for us .
Wanna dance ?
No .
Wish you didn 't have to work tonight .
We could go to Coney Island .
I don 't like Coney Island .
Aw , come on , you don 't .
You did the other night .
That was the other night .
What 's the matter with you , honey ?
Why ?
Nothing .
Oh , yes there is .
Come on , let 's have it .
Tony , I 'll tell you .
I don 't know how to say it , but ...
Tony , I don 't want to get married .
Say , don 't say things like that , I got a week heart .
Tony , I mean it .
I like you an awful lot and all that ... but I just can 't think of getting married right now .
What 's the matter , honey ?
What 's happened ?
Nothing .
I don 't think you 'll be able to understand , but ...
Being born on the stage and all well , getting married and leaving , it seems to be giving up everything .
You told me the other night you wanted to get out of the show business .
That 's how I thought I felt .
When I come right down to it , I just can 't , that 's all .
You 'll never know , Tony , what it feels like to be on the other side of those footlights .
and to hear them clap and clap for you .
It does something to a girl .
I don 't know what .
April , I don 't believe a word you 're saying .
Either you 're lying to me or else you 've just been kidding yourself .
Now , come on , let 's dance and forget about it .
I don 't want to dance .
I want you to get it through your head right now .
This is it , really .
Mother signed a new contract today for a new show .
And there 's a chance for me to go with her in a splendid part .
If I don 't take it I know I 'll be sorry all my life .
Then we 'll both be miserable .
But listen , honey .
That 's no life for you .
Well , I 'm not so sure that married life in some godforsaken farm is a life for me either .
After all , I 'm young .
People tell me I 'm pretty .
Here I 've got a big chance .
I might be a star .
Now , I ask you , Tony ... what girl wouldn 't grab at the chance to land on Broadway in a big show ?
None , I suppose .
Not since you 're locked to them .
Let 's pray it ended up with nothing to be locked with right now .
Tony , don 't look at me like that .
Makes me feel terrible .
I really think you 're an awfully sweet boy , but after all , when it comes to love , why , I 've only known you five days .
You think of jumping into something and giving up a whole career ...
Well , Tony , you ought to understand .
Sure .
I mean , we 'll still have lots of fun together .
Just the same .
Go to lots of parties .
Why , we might even still be engaged .
No .
I wouldn 't want to feel like I 'm tying you down .
Guess I 'd better go back to my ship .
You mean , enlist again ?
Yeah .
Sailing for the West Indies .
I 've always wanted to see the West Indies .
But you 'll come back .
Sure , some day .
What time is it ?
Eight o 'clock , almost .
I could just make it if I hurry .
Tony !
You 're angry with me .
I didn 't want you to be .
Tony , please try not to hate me .
Please try to understand .
This was the best way for us both .
I don 't hate you .
I just gotta hurry , that 's all .
You ought to be getting down to your show too , don 't you ?
I 'll walk to the subway with you .
It 's on my way .
You 'll be late .
I don 't care .
Check , please .
Seventh floor , mam .
Good night , Jim , I 'll see you in the morning .
Good night , honey .
Well , thanks for coming down with me , April .
Oh , that was all right .
Well , here 's my train .
Bye , April .
Bye , Tony .
Don 't cry , kid .
There 'll be another one along any minute .
Cheer up .
April !
April !
April !
April !
April !
Aw , be quiet !
Where 's April ?
Where 's April ?
Mother !
What 's the matter ?
Help me to my dressing room
Well I 'll be ...
Where did she get ?
Mother , you 're sick .
Don 't worry about me .
Is everything all right ?
Everything 's fine .
Are you gonna be married right away ?
No , I sent him back to his ship , ma .
What 's this you 're saying ?
You lie down , you 'll feel better .
Tell me , tell me .
Don 't worry , it 's all over .
I sent him away .
I guess it is jolly life on board .
It 's a good thing we found out in time .
Oh , nothing matters now but you , mommy .
We 'll always have each other .
Nothing 's ever going to separate us again .
Oh , my God .
What have you done ?
What have I done ?
Mommy , you 're not well .
My baby , my little baby .
Well , this is a swell time to be showing up for a Saturday night show .
What 's the matter with her ?
Drunk ?
Well , what if she is ?
Drunk as a fool , look at her lying there , the gin-soaked old ...
You let my mother alone !
You men make me sick .
You don 't care about anything as long as you can shove somebody on your filthy stage .
and make them shake for a bunch of gorillas .
Yeah ?
Well that talk don 't get me anywhere .
So far as I 'm concerned Kitty Darling 's finished .
Here I talk to Gus Weinbaum trying to keep her in the show here ... and look at her , blind , paralyzed , Saturday night with nobody to take her place .
I 'll take her place .
I 'll get out there and get those gorillas your money 's worth .
Now what do you think of that ?
Me take a chance on a dumb chorus girl to fill a specialty number ?
You 're crazy !
Listen , she ain 't so dumb .
I 've been rehearsing her for weeks .
She 's swell , I 'm telling ya .
Anyway ain 't it be better take a chance with the kid ?
Well , maybe it is .
Hop to it , kid .
But you 'd better be good .
Come on , baby , wake up .
Oh , I 'll be good all right .
I 'll get out and give them what they want .
I 'll show them , I 'll show them !
Now you 're talkin ' .
You get out of my way .
Well I 'll be ...
Come on , get out there and play again .
No !
Come on , get out there .
No !
Come on , girls , get out there .
Do something .
Go ahead , get onstage there ...
Come on , you get onstage too .
Tony !
Tony !
I came back because I thought , well , maybe ...
Take me away from this terrible place .
You mean it ?
I never want to be in the stage again .
You know , I had a hunch you weren 't telling me the truth .
Aw , come on , what 's it all about ?
It 's mother .
Tony , I can 't go away and leave her now .
She 's sick .
She needs a home .
Then let her come with us .
That 'll be swell .
Come on , let 's go in and talk to her .
I bet I can make her see it our way .
It would be wonderful if she would .
We 'll always be together , won 't we ?
Yes , honey .
All three of us .
All three of us .

THE END
On the powerful docks of the Wrexham company war and trading vessels are built ... ... machines being built and being taken apart ...
Lord John Bellamont can 't deny that just 25 years ago he was just dockworker , John Wrexham with regards to his son Philipp , he was used to leading the life of luxury .
You will miss me , Philipp , if you go back to Oxford tomorrow .
Don 't you want to spend as long as possible with me today ?
I can 't , Vicky , I still have to say goodbye to my father .
Who is that with Philipp ?
Don 't you know Vicky ?
Her official title is Lady Victoria Burlington , daughter of the Duke of Dover .
We actually lead a pointless existence
- Dance , Jazz and Sparkling Wine serve no purpose in life .
Wake up , sleepy head !
We want to liven this place up !
Let 's go now , Philipp , and I 'll drive with you to the shipyard , to meet your father .
I made a decent offer to the people .
If the staff reject the proposal , I shall lock the whole lot of them out !
That 's O 'Neil , he has a wife and child .
Is the wife of Michael O 'Neil , here ?
Let the insurance company know about the accident and give the widow £ 500 from my cash drawer .
Your son and Lady Victoria are in the shipyard - they will be here soon .
I regret the misfortune most sincerely .
I have made provision for the family accordingly .
A submarine ?
Are some ships to be sunk ?
Yes !
- The ships of other fleets .
Here , spend the money at Oxford , show them that you are the wealthy son of old Wrexham !
This is your last term , in the Autumn you will become my partner .
There 's Lady Bellmont with her latest suitor - a scandal , how the woman behaves - she has an adult son !
Isn 't that your mother ?
I see my mother so rarely , that I hardly recognise her anymore !
Well - if it isnt my son , Philipp ?
If you don 't want to drive me to the Legation Ball , Philipp , then take me home now .
The old University city , Oxford where the rich sons of England study , work and play sport ...
I have acquired a house in the city , which is like a Hotel , and want ...
Haven 't you heard the news ?
Philipp Wrexham suddenly became pious - imagine that , after his earlier mad life !
To inaugurate our Palace
- The Prime Minister , the Lord Chancellor and the first Lord of the Admiralty have confirmed their attendance .
I wish that you , being my intended associate , will fulfill your representational duties .
The Dinner will start at 9 o 'clock .
Your loving , father .
Do you want to come to the tennis court ?
We need real men for our work , hard workers , undemanding tireless fighters .
I am your servant !
- This proud phrase that a German prince could transform the World into a Paradise if only people were to take this seriously .
But ambition , greed and lust for power destroy any hope for happiness .
God ?
God gave us the best will , to love and make our fellow men happy !
That really came from the heart .
Can I count on your co-operation ?
Why haven 't you changed yet ?
Our guests will be here soon .
Leave me with your records in peace - they 're even more warped than you !
... fine , I will be there .
After all I have to dine somewhere .
Why don 't you take off that piece of sheet metal from around your neck ?
You make yourself look ridiculous with your exotic medals .
Actually , I didn 't want you at all .
I was looking for Philipp .
I summoned him here urgently .
Do you know for sure whether he is in London ?
Do you think that he may have had a car accident ?
My lord , the guests are becoming impatient .
... very well , let them serve Dinner .
A telegram , my lord .
I am Lord Bellamont .
Where is my son ?
What is this masquerade ?
Pull yourself together and come home !
Your son is looking for peace with us - let him find it !
And what becomes of me , and my business ?
Don 't you think you have obligations to me - your father ?
I despise the world of your business with its greed , finances and over-indulgence ...
No , father , my decision is made .
You are a fool , if you are to let yourself be talked round by him .
The Three Passions Fifth Act
My God !
What could have happened ?
Worse than suicide - he wants to become a priest !
Thank God , then everything is alright !
He will still , given time , realise that he belongs and has a free life and then the passion will overcome him , it will be stronger than his faith ... ... the Love !
If you are able to straighten his head out , you can ask of me , whatever you want .
If I can get him back , I don 't know what else I could still possibly wish for !
In the Seamen 's Mission
For three days I haven 't eaten anything , dear Lady .
I don 't want Vicky to stay here .
Can you write ?
Philipp will not hold out .
Today he almost kissed me !
Difficult days followed for old Lord Bellamont .
No word from Philipp
- A strike at the Shipyard ...
I have one more chance
- I still have night duty at the Seamen 's Mission .
His work means more to him than Love .
They don 't know how wealthy he is , I 'm glad that I can help him .
I shall wipe my hands of him
- I shall also cope without you .
You must do the night duty alone tonight .
'scuse me , lady - it 's just a force of habit !
... is everything in my hat , lady !
If you come out , you can surely be a little bit nice !
Son fights at the Wrexham Shipyard .
Lord Bellamont rejects arbitral award .
8000 workers locked out .
Lord Bellamont is very sick .
A nervous breakdown is confirmed .
The disturbances , which are
Telephone my son - quick !
Hurry , for God sake hurry !
Young sir , your father is dieing .
Get the people back in again - the work starts up again ...
Your demands are met , if you will agree to immediately start work again !
This is your place , Philipp - yours and Vicky 's - the workers need you !

Go ahead ...

" You 're wrong !
Either we go together or we don 't go at all ... "
" Don 't be mad , I was stupid .
Of course I 'll go with you . "
" ... in half an hour ! "
" Stascha ... we 'll always be together , won 't we ? "
" I can 't live without you , Stascha "
" I 'd rather turn ourselves in than let you go ! "
" And now you can go to him , if you dare to - "
" Please understand ...
I couldn 't come ...
You have to forgive me . "
" I 'm a murderer ! "
" On the second floor , commissioner . "
" Is this the kind of happiness you 've yearned for ? "
" I 've commited a murder ! "
" Karoff murdered my husband , so he could free me from him ... "
" ... and I have tolerated it ... "
" Poor Stascha !
In spite of everything ...
I love you ... ! "
" Please , to the backstairs ! "
" For what destination shall I buy a ticket ? "
" I 'm ... going ... home ... "
" Farewell , Sir ! "

MANOLESCU 1929
For George Manolescu , the day begins at 7 a.m. ...
" Don 't switch on the light !
...
Let the sun shine in ... "
" What 's going on ?
- We will arrive too late at the club . "
" Attention , Jack !
Watch the second column . "
" There is a criminal aboard the train . "
" I fled my husband I greatly feared he would order someone to bring me back ... "
" I am very grateful to you , but ... "
" Dearest , I left my umbrella in the compartment . "
" What room is the lady in ? "
" Yes , Marquis ... "
" As you wish , Marquis ... "
" It will be done for you , Marquis ... "
" Please notify Room 217 that Count Lahovary wishes to speak to the gracious Lady . "
" Right away , Count . "
" ...
For three days , I 've been searching for you , without success ... "
" I 'm not mistaken ... we know each other very well ... from the train . "
" Count Lahovary !
The charm of a train acquaintanceship is its brevity . "
" Do you have a room available ? "
" Do you want a room on the south side , Count ? "
" I found your umbrella . "
" What do you want from me ? "
" Ask for the house detective . "
" It 's me , baby , your little Jack . "
" One moment please ...
I have to get dressed ... "
" Wait on the balcony ...
I 'll explain it to you later . "
" Please get dressed for dinner ... "
" Go !
Please leave !
I will explain it to you afterwards ... "
" I will leave shortly ... we must separate now . "
" I won 't leave you - we will stay together . "
" We stay together ?
...
Could you then , offer me the life I am used to living ? "
" Come on , get packed . "
That 's how George Manolescu 's life as a swindler began .
" Did you bring some samples ? "
" We would like to try it out . "
" Could you please exchange 20 fifty Mark notes for a thousand Mark note ? "
Telephone booth
" I am convinced ...
Your 100,000 in exchange for 40,000 real ones . - ... But I only take over the ' goods ' after we get on the train . "
" You wanted these 100,000 Mark notes changed for fresh 50 Mark notes ? "
" I left my briefcase on the train ... "
" ... a briefcase bearing the initials V.T. ... containing 50 bills of 100,000 Mark notes "
" I will have it investigated immediately ... "
" A briefcase has been left behind in here . "
" Thanks to you ... everything is in order . "
" A very clever forgery , - the real pearl necklace must have been substituted . "
Robbery
Forgery
" I won 't tolerate your behavior . "
" We will drive back home in a minute ... "
" Why are you so upset ?
...
I only make friends who can help in our ' business ' ... "
" Be cautious !
We are being watched . "
" Your Cleo is in Paris .
I know where she lives . "
" For once I need to speak to you ...
I have had enough of your temper and your jealousy !
... "
" Leave me alone ...
I cannot , and won 't , continue life as we live it now ... "
" Right , your highness !
We are going to live in a kitchen-cum-living room ... "
" Lovely !
The repentant sinner Manolescu ... "
" You coward ! "
" I am so happy !
...
You are back with me ... "
" Scoundrel "
Robbery
Swindle
Forgery
" Cleo ... all because of ... you ... "
" Make photocopies immediately !
Manolescu supposedly is in Paris . "
" Jeanette ... your coming delights me very much ... "
" I am so glad you are finally doing better . "
" You have awakened me to a new life ... "
" The ' Journal ' !
...
The ' Journal ' !
...
The latest news about Manolescu ... "
" We urgently need to speak alone . "
" I am not to be blamed for what has happened ... please , forgive me . "
" This is your doing ... ! "
" I have to ask you to leave the sick alone . "
" Aren 't you a little bit too concerned about your patients ?
.. "
" I am only fullfilling my duty as a nurse . "
" Doctor , I believe I will recover faster in seclusion than here . "
" Winter sun and mountain air would be good for you ... "
" Could nurse Jeanette accompany me as caregiver ? "
" He left on a journey with Sister Jeanette ... "
" Could you please give me his address ? "
" What do I want ?
-
- You ! "
" We belong to each other ...
I would never let anyone else have you . "
" I hate you . "
" May I congratulate you on your fine lover ... "
" ... a thief ... "
" ... a swindler .. "
" Get out ! "
New Year 's Eve
" Are you George Manolescu ? "
" You are under arrest . "
" ...
I will be right back , Jeanette ... "
" I am at your disposal ... "
" ... but ... it 's New Year 's Eve ... please take that into regard ... "
" ... give me ten more minutes ... "
MANOLESCU , King of Swindlers .
Ninth Act .
" Jeanette , these gentlemen got lost ...
I asked them to come in ... "
" I will stay with you ... forever ... "
" ... what about Manolescu ?
.. "
" I ... betrayed ... him ... "
" George , pour the champagne , it 's almost midnight ! "
" All the best for the New Year ! "
" It 's time now . "
" I know , Jeanette ... it is I. "
" George !
I am waiting for you ! "
Mascotte had to stand still all the year round so she was all the more lively at the ball of the Parisian painters and models
Gaby , Mascotte 's friend
" It is nothing ... "
" ... you only mustn 't dance that exuberantly . "
" That little girl probably hasn 't eaten her fill very often in her life . "
" She is a painter 's model ...
like I. "
" A few months in Davos - that could save her perhaps . "
" Wouldn 't that cost an awful lot of money ? "
" It 's certainly going to take five or six thousand francs . "
" Let 's hold an auction !
Each of you donates a picture . "
" First we auction off this painting ... "
" ... depicting ... "
" ... the eruption of Mount Vesuvius ! "
" Madonna under Cherry Trees ! "
" Nine francs and forty ! "
" 9 Francs 40, going once , going twice ... "
" ... going ... "
" My husband ! "
" ... my husband ... "
" May I get you a little refreshment ? "
" Hello , Jean ! "
" Have you met Mr. Gaston Duprés ?
... "
" Im happy to see that you enjoy yourself , Josette ... "
" Eight hundred francs , all in all ... "
" Perhaps your nude portrait will fetch a higher price . "
" I bid ten times as much ... "
" ... but for the model in the original ! "
" The original will be auctioned off ! "
" I 'll pose for free for fourteen days for whoever bids most ! "
" Do you really want to embarass me in front of everybody ? "
" Is nobody going to bid more ?
... "
Nobody ?
" 4900 going once ... "
" ... going twice ... "
" You 'll travel to Switzerland and get well again ... "
" ... so well that you can dance whole nights through again . "
" Has my wife come home ? "
" No , but right now a messenger has brought this letter . "
" I 'm coming to Mr. Dardier as a model . "
" There 's a model who wants to talk to you . "
" Don 't you recognize me ? "
" I 've come to thank you in my friend 's name , and ... "
" It wasn 't meant that way !
Today I don 't need a model !
You may just go home ! "
" Thank you ! "
" Please stay ! "
Jean , after all that has happened , there 's no place in your house for me anymore .
I ask you to arrange for Adrienne to bring my clothes into the hotel .
You took my harmless flirt with Gaston as a cause to take part in this scandalous auction and to snub me in front of all people .
You alone are responsible for all this .
Josette
" Let me take your coat ! "
" You look enchanting ! "
" Im looking forward to our fourteen days ! "
" Do you know , Mr. Dardier , that your wife loves you ?
... "
" ...
Otherwise , would she write such jealous letters to you ? "
" I heard about what has happened ... "
" I may be an advocate by profession , but you know :
first of all I 'm your friend !
... "
" How bitter for someone like you who so rarely associates with someone new ! "
" I 'll leave you alone ... "
... with your pain ! "
" Giron is the biggest gossip of Paris . "
" Now the whole city will think that you are my mistress . "
" You could wish for nothing better !
... "
" Keep me here for fourteen days , and I 'll get you back your wife ! "
" When she 's mad with jealousy she will return of her own accord ! "
" It 's a deal !
... "
" ...
And now we 're going to get some clothes for you . "
" You can 't walk around as a pirate for two weeks ! "
" I 've got an awful lot to tell you . "
" ... nude .... "
" Things shape up well , it 's Madame Dardier . "
" How are you , my dear Gaston ? "
" You call me by my name , Josette ? "
The pact was made - the intrigue began .
" My spy service works . "
Today Six Day Race
Art Exhibition 11 o 'clock
" You can let go now , - she doesn 't see us anymore . "
" She 's already taking the bait ! "
" To your health ! "
" ...
Darling ! "
" To your health , darling ! "
" You 'll see , not three days will pass , - and she returns . "
" That 's good for you , Mr. Dardier . "
" Good night , little Mascotte ! "
" Good morning , little Mascotte ! "
" What are the two of them doing this evening ? "
" They don 't go out today . "
" Then you have a day off , Mascotte ... "
" ... or would you like to keep me company in the evening ? "
" I will order a little dinner ... "
" ...
Mademoiselle will pretty herself up nicely and do me the honour to be my guest .
" How beautiful it is to have dinner without having to make someone jealous ! "
" But don 't keep me waiting for long , I 'm terribly hungry ! "
" I 'm just getting my jewellery .
We 're ...
I am going to Nice tomorrow . "
" ...
I knew you would come back to me ! "
" Dinner is served . "
" Lay a third place ! "
" You don 't expect me to sit at one table with this ... person ! "
" But didn 't you realise that everything with Mascotte was just an act ? "
" And what about Gaston Duprés ? "
" I 've of course put an end to that affair before I went to you . "
" Now I have to pretty myself up .
After all , I have to fight dangerous competition . "
" ... at ten o 'clock in the Café de Paris ! "
" Madame will be there soon . "
" Where is Mascotte ? "
" She must be afraid of you ... "
" Sorry , I don 't want to disturb . "
" Serve the ladies and gentlemen in there
- I 'll eat in a restaurant ! "
" Right , now you can marry me ! "
" And where is Mr. Dardier ? "
" The ladies and gentlemen have all left . "
" You want to leave me , Mascotte ? "
" The fourteen days are over ... "
" Couldn 't you add one more evening- - "
" Please put me through to the advocate Giron . "
" Ask him if I can come to him now , ...
concerning my divorce . "
" Di-vorce . "
" Doctor Giron is expecting you ! "
" Why are you getting divorced , Mr. Dardier ? "
" Can 't you guess , Mascotte ?
.. "
" I called for you because now the going gets rough . "
" Go back to Dardier repentantly , - I 'll talk him round to forgive you . "
" Mr. Dardier ! "
" And if I meet that - - person there ? "
" - -- then you say that you 've reconciled here at my place . "
" ...
So you 're really firmly resolved to get divorced ?
... "
Power of attorney
" I 've done something stupid , - you have make good for it ... "
" ...
Hurry to Dardier and take Josette with you before her husband returns . "
" My dear , I owe it to you that I 've finally found my way back to Jean . "
" But didn 't he file for divorce ? "
" ... and we 've reconciled at the advocate 's ! "
" Where is Mascotte ? "
My former master in such cases used to console with a trip to the south .
" Jean , it seems you don 't love me anymore ! "
" Where is Mascotte ? "
" Gone !
Thank God , gone ! "
" In a packed travel car with Gaston ! "
" I 'm going to Nice and get Mascotte back to me ! "
" Now I 've given up Gaston ...
for his sake ... ! "
" ... and you know that I cannot be alone ! "
" Then go with him and get Gaston back to you ! "
" I was left high and dry ... "
" - you were left high and dry ... "
" ...
What business do the two of us have in Paris ?
! "
" Which is why we 're going to Nice ! "
" Do you have berths for Nice ? "
" The lady and the gentleman are married ?
... "
" Shared compartment , then ! "
" No , - separate ! "
" The front axle is twisted , - I can 't repair the car here . "
" It 's ten kilometers to the next station , perhaps you can reach a train to Nice there . "
" Sleeping car ! "
Do you have berths for Nice ? "
" ... together ! "
" I 'm sorry , I only have one gents' and one ladies ' bed left . "
" When do we arrive at the next station ? "
" I 'm getting off . "
" But nobody needs to know about it ! "
" Little Mascotte , are you already awake ? "
" Who is there ? "
" Who else but your little Gaston ! "
" Where is Mascotte ? "
" What did you do with Mascotte ? "
The end .

The organist at st.Vitus cathedral
A film by
With
When evening falls over Prague
and the bells play their sublime song
High above the city , like God 's stone guardian , stands the cathedral of st.Vitus , its tall towers connecting heaven and earth .
While the lights of the city are being lit
the sound of organ breaks the silent night .
Every night , this odd man plays in the empty cathedral .
The organ is his whole world .
He lived alone in a house in the ancient Golden lane .
A man called Josef Falk worked only when hunger made him to .
What do you want ?
You ?
I thought you were in prison .
I could not stand the prospect of a life sentence .
I ran away .
Please , don 't ask .
As an old friend , please give the money and the letter to my daughter .
Why can 't you do it yourself ?
I 've seen everything
Please , I don 't want to deal with the police , the courts ...
The best thing you can do is get him away from here , then .
I will tell noone .
If you act reasonably , that is .
Bury him there -
So white , so pure .
She knew nothing about the world .
She was only dreaming of it .
She felt that outside the tall walls , there is a storm of life and love that a heart devoted to God will never know .
The painter Ivan , attracted by everything mysterious -
Klara , there 's a visitor for you .
I am the organist at st.Vitus. I 'm bringing you money from your father .
Where is my father ?
He died .
Did he leave any message for me ?
The news from the organist awakened a new desire for life
Please , I beg you , let me go !
Go back to your cell , my child , and pray .
God will bring peace back to your mind .
But the calling of life and freedom was to powerful
The organist keeps thinking about the grim secret of friend 's death .
I have left the monastery .
I can 't live there anymore .
Please , tell me what happened to my father .
I got a message about his death and I got the money for you .
That 's all I know .
Why did you come here ?
You are the only person I know .
I can 't go back there .
Please !
Alone
In the sublime silence of the cathedral , by his beloved organ , the organists finds peace again .
At dawn ,
the organist returns home .
I brought this - for you .
So I don 't look like a nun anymore ?
Klara has turned a bachelor 's lonely place to a happy , quiet home .
I 've composed this song for you , Klara .
What would you like ?
I 'd like to talk to the organist .
I 'll wait for him here , If I may .
That 's all I have .
And what about that money ?
I gave it to his daughter .
So you won 't give me more ?
Down there -
is your father !
The organist killed him !
Is it true ?
Let me explain .
I ...
Murderer !
Klara has stayed in Ivan 's house .
Like a bad dream , yesterday 's events were left in the past .
Klara set forth on a journey of appiness .
Are you happy , Klara ?
Why are you so cold towards me ?
Don 't you like me ?
A little bit ?
The organist remained alone and smile has left his face .
The fateful blow he has suffered has caused a paralysis of his right hand .
Why can 't we get closer ?
Why are you torturing me ?
Stop asking , please .
Perhaps one day I will tell you everything .
After many weeks of loneliness and desperation , he just wanted to see his beloved organ .
Can you hear that ?
The old organist is playing again .
Klara has decided to resolve the painful secret .
Come with me .
Now .
She 's there too .
You must tell her the truth .
Ivan !
I don 't want to live anymore .
I have lost everything I had to live for .
I have hurt you so bad .
Let me make things right again .
There is a man coming to see you .
Dear Klara , I am not brave enough to say farewell to you .
I am leaving this world voluntarily , for I can 't live anymore .
Be blessed , my child , and forgive your unhappy father .
It was all my fault .
The organist is innocent .
...
He is so unhappy .
Please visit him .
I have hurt him too .
I will visit him and ask for forgiveness .
Another blow of fate was waiting for the lonely old man .
FROM THE CATHEDRAL OFFICE We regret to learn that your paralysis has left you uncapable of carrying out the work of organist
Thank you for your years of exemplary work .
We hereby retire you .
Signed ...
The desperate man has made a dreadful decision .
A great excitement has filled the old heart .
A miracle happened .
My dear friend , I have hurt you so much and made you suffer .
For your kindness , I only gave ingratitude in return .
Please forgive me .
I will never forget you !
I am sending you flowers that you loved so much .
Yours , Klara .

They 're rare .
Difficult to find
To be honest , I 'm a poor skier
You looked great where it hadn 't snowed
Is the inn still far ?
How many more electric poles ?
136 more
At the 130th electric pole
I 'll go skiing .
You take a bath and rest
Yamamoto came , too , right ?
Where are you going ?
I can 't stop
Out of the way !
You should have moved !
I 'm sorry
I could hardly recognized you
Why so restless ?
Overlook it , will you ?
Humans are beggars after all
They all want something
First of all , I want socks
I failed , so I 'll knit new ones for you
Something in return for the socks
I forgot all
I 'd memorized for the exams
I didn 't even try to memorize anything
You 'll flunk
Don 't scare me
We 'll get up early tomorrow
That girl is my friend
Would you like some tea ?
May I join you for a sip ?
Thanks for the tea
Thank you for the tea ?
Hey , you look pale
Why don 't we act more like gentlemen ?
Dance to the rhythm of floor sound
Stop crying we 'll meet again someday
Another fine day in the mountains
Your uncle 's smart , huh ?
A prospective marriage interview in the snow ?
Great !
Put yourself in my shoes .
I 'm shy
No skiing today ?
I think I 'll go see her
He 's under that flag
Don 't interfere , huh ?
Let 's go have some coffee
His girl is a real beauty
He can 't jump anymore
The Next Day
Leaving so soon ?
Goodbye !
Badger 'll give us at least 40 points
Been skiing , boys ?
You 'd better study , too
In Tokyo , the west wind has blown steadily since morning
Smile .

SEVEN FOOTSTEPS TO SATAN
The jokes that people play sometimes have dramatic aspects .
But the dramatic pretence becomes grotesque , moves to a laugh ... and the joke concludes happily .
Part One
What is the mysterious undertaking for which James Kirkham prepares ?
( Played by Creighton Hale )
Who could it be at this hour ?
I don 't want anyone to see the cases that are in the hall .
Fetch me some other shells .
Nothing much will happen this evening .
Where is my crazy nephew ?
Is he still determined to leave ?
Asking for more shells .
Imagine !
He 's bought enough to furnish a whole army .
Here ?
Remember this .
It 's your decision to enter .
James !
Are you crazy ?
Good evening Uncle Joe !
I 'm practicing .
An explorer must be a handy with a gun and shoot without ever missing .
An explorer , you ?
Where on earth are you going to explore ?
I 've decided to embark on a daring expedition to darkest Africa .
You 're a fool to squander money in this reckless fashion .
Squander ?
I want to prove to everyone that in the centre of Africa is the oldest civilization in the world .
You wouldn 't last ten days out there !
The millions inherited from your father have scrambled your brains .
Why don 't you marry ?
Eva would cure you of these crazy ideas .
But first I want to be a famous explorer .
You haven 't even explored your own garden !
Mr. Kirkham , a lady wishes to speak to you .
I 've told you .
I don 't wish to see anyone .
Sorry to disturb you James , but I 've something to tell you .
I 'm sorry Jim , that you don 't wish to hear me .
I understand your feelings Uncle but a life of adventure attracts me irresistibly .
I 'm not cross you didn 't come to find me .
I know how very busy you are with your approaching journey .
I 've come to ask you a great favour .
You know my father 's collection of antiques , don 't you James ?
Well , he 's decided to display them at our reception this evening .
But I have strong doubts about one of the guests .
Could you tell me if this is
Professor Wrede , director of the Museum of Dresden ?
Yes ... no ... yes ...
I can see a certain resemblance , but it doesn 't really seem to be him .
The guests will have arrived by now .
Could you come with me straight away ?
Wait a moment and I 'll be with you .
This is the famous Romanoff emerald .
Welcome to New York , Professor
I don 't seem to remember you .
Yes ... yes ... now I remember .
You ... you are ...
This is most strange ...
I have your name on the tip of my tongue .
Don 't make a fuss .
Follow me .
Give me a reason for this outrage !
Go and get the police .
The telephone lines have been cut .
Quick !
...
To the police station !
Look Eva , it 's not glass .
It 's made of steel .
This isn 't my car !
We 're caught in a trap !
But it 's my chauffeur who 's driving .
How long has this chauffeur been working for you ?
Only a week .
The car has stopped .
What 's going to happen now ?
Resistance is useless !
Get in the house .
Pay attention if you want to save you skins .
But who are you ?
And where are we ?
Silence !
Here , even the walls have ears .
A little word in your ear ...
Follow me .
I will take you to your room .
But we don 't wish to stay here .
Watch out !
Watch out for the man with crutches .
Your rooms are on the top floor .
But I repeat , we want to return home .
Make no demands !
Do as I say , follow me !
We 'd better do as she says .
Why must we ?
I think it would be best to follow .
You bet !
But , we want to go away from here .
Leave her !
Leave her !
Stay there with your fiancée !
For how long ?
Perhaps an hour ...
Perhaps a month ...
Perhaps a year ...
Perhaps forever ...
Satan will decide ...
But don 't you understand ?
We want to leave .
Save me !
Satan has ordered them to give me 100 lashes of the whip !
Don 't let them take your fiancée !
Watch out ...
Satan 's gorilla has escaped !
I am Satan 's handmaiden .
Rubbish !
I don 't understand a thing !
The girl will sleep here .
Don 't leave me James !
Don 't leave me alone !
She will sleep here !
It 's an order !
Do as I tell you or you will learn how Satan punishes those who disobey his orders .
But we want to go back home ...
But who is Satan ?
He is the master !
Look there !
A hand !
Go and look for the police if you are able !
Satan has kept me prisoner here for many months without bread and without water .
I 'm sorry to have frightened you .
I 've come to talk to your companion .
But I don 't want to help Satan .
I serve Satan and I have orders to take whatever there is in your right pocket .
Your father 's emerald !
This will do for Satan 's collection of antiques .
But it 's a very precious jewel .
and it belongs to Eva 's father .
Give me the emerald .
Put it in the room of treasures .
Here people are distinguished by a number .
You are number 741 and your companion is 742 .
Your dinner is waiting in the adjoining room .
I 'd rather have dinner at home .
Don 't move , or I 'll kill you .
Take this key , if you have the courage to leave this house before Satan kills you all .
Follow the corridor until you reach room number 13 and tell whoever you find there that everything is ready .
Excuse me , but I must return a moment to my room .
You said , room ...
room ... number 13 ...
End of Part One
Room 13
Who are you ?
What do you want ?
The maid has asked me to tell you that everything is ready .
Get out !
You 're another of Satan 's spies !
You 've come here to trap me .
But ... but the maid said ...
I believe that you recognize the faithful agents of Satan .
The explanation for your disappearance will be drawn up by us , and divulged to the newspapers .
Let me go !
I can 't possibly be of any use to Satan .
Satan will provide the due justification .
Sign this paper .
I refuse to sign a blank piece of paper .
Call for the Spider .
Take the girl away until this imbecile learns to obey our master .
If I sign , can my can stay with me ?
Finally !
You are beginning to see sense .
Take him away !
The Professor sent me .
Take this key .
Trust no one in this house except Professor Moriarity .
Your life is in danger .
The password ?
I am one of the unnamed brothers .
Praise be to Satan .
Any of the cars in the courtyard will take you wherever you desire to go , brother .
Return to your room .
They are taking your fiancée away .
I am one of the unnamed brothers .
Praise be to Satan .
Excuse me brother , but there is a traitor trying to escape .
I must take you down here and no one at present can leave the house .
Didn 't you know it is forbidden to enter here masked ?
Silence !
Satan approaches !
Satan will accord two women the honour of dining at his own table .
Be seated !
Satan will join his guests .
Come on , cowards !
Let 's kill the fiend !
Silence !
Don 't make a sound !
If I am discovered ...
they 'll kill us both .
I am Professor Moriarity .
I 've come to help you .
What have they done with Eva ?
They have taken her to Satan 's room .
This is the Spider 's room .
Satan 's is there .
We 're trapped .
We 'll never get out of here alive .
Kill the traitors !
Kill them !
Silence !
Satan is here !
Let the trial commence !
Prisoners , you will be saved if you can manage to climb the seven steps of the stairway of Satan .
If you guess the four true steps you will be immediately freed ...
For each false step you will remain one year in Satan 's service .
Four false steps means Death !
Look at the swines !
They don 't deserve such generosity .
I despise you all !
Devils !
Blackguards !
I 'll do whatever you wish if only you will free this girl .
Silence !
Satan desires the prisoners ' response .
If you manage to escape death you will serve me in a matter of the greatest importance .
I will do whatever you say if you let this girl go .
The salvation of the girl is agreed .
Now , the seven steps .
If you turn to look at the gauge your life will be finished .
Your life is saved .
But by the oath you have made you have sworn , for three years to serve our master .
Very well !
I will serve him for three years .
When the young lady is freed .
Uncle Joe !
What are you doing here ?
Me ?
Satan .
You talked of adventure .
Here 's enough to last a lifetime .
Jacques , the bill !
Mr. Talandier is leaving so early ?
I have to attend the divorce of my future bride-to-be !
Tomorrow I 'll come at the usual time , hopefully not alone .
Waiter !
Count Lerski ?
I recognized you at once , Colonel Dymow !
I 'm sincerely sorry , dear Lerski .
You needn 't be sorry ...
I 've learnt to work !
Divorcing hurts but not n the case of Mr. and Mrs. Gerard .
See , Laurence ?
These superficialities are the reason to our divorce .
Adolphe , it was nice of you to take all the debt .
Laurence , today belongs to us !
Chubby-chops , would you do me a big favour ?
Inform Percy that I expect him tonight .
If he is free earlier , he is to meet me at the Place Vendôme at half past seven .
Anisette .. ?
Today 's my free day .
Let 's meet at the Place Vendôme at half past seven .
Jacques 's girlfriend Anisette is waiting at the Place Vendôme at 7.30 .
He isn 't coming !
Surely he isn 't coming !
Quick , quick !
We can 't stop here !
Aren 't you happy , Percy ?
You aren 't Percy !
I never said I was !
I mistook you for somebody else ...
There 's a baffling resemblance between you two !
Now you 've waited long enough .. !
Don 't you find it difficult to leave me ?
No !
End of 1st act
That 's Mr. Percy !
I 'm curious about the future master !
Please announce me to the lady !
Madam is already expecting you !
Come in !
Please , come closer !
Kiss me !
What are you looking for ?
You ... impostor !
I 'm returning your divorce certificate !
Thank you for the friendly reception !
Mr. Percy conveys his deepest regrets for not being able to come today !
1What are you saying ...
Why can 't he come ?
Mr. Percy left an hour ago ...
He 'll be away on travel for quite a while .
Leaving already , Mr. Percy ?
In God 's name , come quick , the lady ... !
Have a glass of champagne , madam .
It 'll do you good .
Are you still here ?
Who are you , really ?
Count Ilja Lerski .
I 've ill-treated you .
Please forgive me .
It was nice of you to return the papers .
End of 2nd act .
Should I go now ?
Must I really go ?
What 's the point ?
You 'll soon come back anyway .
May I introduce you gentlemen to each other ?
Seems I 've already had the pleasure or maybe I 'm wrong .
Chubby-chops ...
Do you love me ?
Then you 'll take the dogs out .
Stay until I call you back .
Do you always serve the ladies like that ?
I 'd like to dance with you .
Let 's go to Montmartre .
To Picadilly !
End of 3rd act .
That 's the waiter from the Grillon restaurant !
How wonderful that you went to the Place Vendôme today !
... and how wonderful that I didn 't let myself be kicked out of your apartment .
Do you know him ?
Yes , unfortunaetly .
I 'd rather it were you .
I don 't take tips from colleagues .
Come to me tomorrow at 12 o 'clock .
I wouldn 't have thought that of her .
Thank God !
End of 4th act
I don 't want my ex-wife to be seen with you in public .
Mr. Gerard means that he ... even if divorced ... nevertheless still ...
I 'll talk straight :
How much do you want ?
I know what I 'd do if you were a gentleman instead of a waiter .
If I 'd taken a rich wife , you 'd consider me a gentleman ...
If I 'd make a fortune gambling , you 'd consider me a gentleman ...
But a waiter ...
I 've become a waiter to be able to remain a gentleman !
So , gentlemen , there 's nothing left to say !
I kiss your hand , madam , and imagine it 's your mouth .
I am ah so chivalrous , madam , and there 's a reason for it .
First I 'd have your confidence , madam , and your sympathy .
If you first bank on me , madam , then you 'll see , madam ,
Instead of your hand , madam , I 'll kiss your red lips .
How could you let yourself be seen with that person ?
The person is Count Lerski .
Nonsense !
He is a waiter at restaurant Grillon !
Waiter !
Here 's 500 Francs for yesterday 's expenses .
Here 's a thousand francs , madam .
That 's how much the delights were worth to me !
End of 5th act .
Waiter !
Appetizers ... !
Soup .
Chicken .
Fruit .
Waiter !
Serve me , please !
Waiter , the bill !
The thousand Francs are your gratuity .
Mr. Director , the waiter Jacques behaves outrageously !
As bad as I feel about it , I have to let you go .
... but there 's an open position for a room waiter in our hotel .
The waiter Jacques has been fired , madam .
I 'd like to do something for the discharged waiter .
I doubt he 'd accept anything .
Jacques is Count Lerski , a former Russian Guard-officer .
Do you know what I just learnt ?
He didn 't lie .
He really is Count Lerski .
Suddenly you aren 't nice to me anymore , chubby-chops .
End of 6th act .
I 'd like a room on the third floor .
I 'd like a room on the third floor .
My deepest apologies - the third floor is completely booked .
Only room 222 , which has been reserved by telegraph , is unoccupied .
Once Jacques started serving there , the third floor has become a veritable harem !
Waiter !
Yes !
Bring me Tea , rolls , jam and butter , please .
Yes , madam .
Did I order the tea from you , sir ?
No , madam .
It was my colleague Jacques , who just had himself transferred to the first floor .
I 'd like a room on the first floor !
Now you won 't run away from me again !
I 've come to ask for your forgiveness , Count Lerski .
After you heard that the " ordinary waiter " was a real Count !
I resign !
I resign for the lady who loves the title instead of the man .
And now will you give me the key ?
Now , instead of your hand , madam , I kiss your red lips .
You 've got to have luck .
And you must be pretty .
Jacques , the bill !
Mr. Talandier is leaving so early ?
I have to attend the divorce of my future bride-to-be !
Tomorrow I 'll come at the usual time , hopefully not alone .

Dreams are so foolish !
The End
This copy was made from the original negative print .
The Hinterland
Algeria isn 't just a picturesque region used by caravans with no camels but also a land of prodigious industrial and commercial activity
... and of great agricultural richness .
Algiers
That day the mail boat from Marseille brought to Algiers a young man who had spent a large inheritance .
... and a young girl on her way to collect an inheritance from an uncle in Algiers .
Pierre Hoffer , the big spender , liked a lot Claudin Duvernet , who was about to inherit .
Manuel Duvernet and his sister Diane ,
Claudie 's cousins , were firmly counting on the inheritance .
Sometimes one is happy to meet old friends from the regiment ;
Pierre was thrilled to meet Zoubir .
No way you 're staying at a hotel !
You 're staying with me .
The Duvernet family 's lawyer ...
" ... and I appoint as sole legatee my niece Claudie . "
Your old uncle didn 't forget you .
He has paid your debts .
Miss , you 're inheriting a villa at Sidi Ferruch .
... and in the south , a large esate .
Since the car now belongs to you , you can do the driving .
... I wish the voyage would have lasted another hour ;
I was in love .
To think that I will never see her again !
Pierre Hoffer had agreed to temporarily stay with his friend Zoubir .
I 'm starting to think that one doesn 't necessarily have to be a sucker to get married .
As for money matters ...
I 'm counting on my uncle Christian Hoffer .
He 's the reason why I 'm coming to Algeria .
Christian Hoffer is rich , but he 's of an odd sort .
You may end up being disappointed .
I was two years old when he saw me last .
He 's kept an fond memory of me .
At Sidi Ferruch , the villa that Claudie Duvernet had inherited .
Christian Hoffer , Pierre 's uncle , had come to Algeria as a poor man .
Now he had become one of the richest farmers of the region .
The Hoffer farm is here , right ?
Tell me , my good man , do you know Christian Hoffer ?
Slightly .
That 's me !
You 're my nephew ?
Dinner time at the Hoffer farm .
Hold your appetite !
We 're waiting for my nephew who just arrived from Paris .
Why on earth are you dressed as a waiter ?
Meanwhile , in Claudie Duvernet 's villa .
Why are you drinking like that ?
Do you have those 72.000 francs that I owe ?
There is a way to get that money ...
But you don 't have any vigor !
Oh , if I was only a man ...
Madam is served .
Pardon miss , but that is the place of the mistress of the house .
The next morning , Christian Hoffer had decided he would have his nephew see his farmland .
So lazybones , you still think you are in Paris ?
We 're going to watch the ploughing , so don 't put on a tox .
Let 's go .
Today he 's dressed like a fool .
It seemed a simple thing to ask
Christian Hoffer for money from afar .
In person , it seemed different ...
How much ?
A hundred thousand .
I will pay you back ... naturally .
Do you have any idea how much work it takes us to raise a hundred thousand francs ?
A hundred years ago , our predecessors found nothing but swampland here .
Before it was transformed into fertile soil ; thousands of settlers died during the effort .
While they were here , our grandfathers needed better roads .
That 's why we were waiting for you to turn up , son .
It was here , at Sidi Ferruch , that the French troops disembarked in 1830 .
You will have your hundred thousand francs , but on one condition ...
That you spend six months working here , in order to learn the value of hard labor .
Agreed !
A week went by ...
Hey !
You over there !
What can you do ?
There 's a shortage on labor in Algeria , they say .
What a lovely day !
Claudie , I have to speak with my uncle ...
I must talk to him right away !
What fair weather !
Uncle , I have decided to marry .
And with whom ?
With Claudie Duvernet .
And you claimed that you loved the earth .
A woman passes by and you are ready to go .
Because you will follow her to Paris as soon as she has sold the property , right ?
And I thought that I had found a son in you ...
What will become of me ?
Claudie Duvernet had decided to go visit the farmland that she owned in the South .
Pierre had apparently abandoned his projects .
I come to say goodbye , I 'm leaving for the South tomorrow .
Claudie Duvernet left yesterday .
We 'll need to make up a plot so that I can accompany you .
You are buying sheep ;
Zoubir is selling just that on his farm .
He 's leaving tonight .
Alright , then !
We 'll go see the flock .
In the meantime , Claudie arrived at the estate inherited from her uncle .
ESTATE FOR SALE
This farm is giving no profit .
We put it on sale at our uncle 's death .
We thought that we were doing the right thing .
Claudie Duvernet is the one that you need to ask for instructions .
The estate belongs to her .
Claudie was taken with her new domain .
She discovered unknown distractions thanks to the falconer Ahmed .
To think that the domain would be ours if it wasn 't for that girl .
Still we can do nothing to her ...
At Zoubir 's place ...
You were talking about a gazelle hunt .
Can 't you invite my uncle and Claudie ?
I want them to get acquainted .
Very good !
I 'll join you .
I would gladly spend my whole life here .
I hope that your cousins will do me the honor of joining the hunt as well .
I would be glad to , but my brother can 't .
He 's busy that day .
Why don 't you want me to take part in the hunt ?
You probably have better things to do .
That girl robbed us !
We should have gotten the inheritance .
We will get it in the end !
What if I married Claudie ?
Leaving for the hunt .
This time there 's no going back .
You 're not chickening out ?
You think you 're clever because you forced me into meeting that girl that I didn 't want to see .
But that 's your driver .
You brought him to the hunt ?
He 's an excellent beater .
I even advice you to take him with you during the hunt .
Claudie Duvernet 's horse had taken the bit between its teeth ...
What a disgraceful thing we have done .
This form of hunting is barbarous ...
If you are tired , I can take you to the citadel , miss .
I 'm dying ...
I want to clear my conscience ...
I have done a misdeed .
I am in a hopeless situation , Claudie ...
Only you can save me .
You must marry me .
You are in my power , and
I am prepared to do anything .
I will kill you if I have to .
By the palm grove ...
You could still catch him ...
This kidnapping story is just another set-up .
You 'll have to choose between the girl and me .
For the last time , will you marry me or do you prefer to die ?
The chamel wadi went to block the road for the fugitives .
Sell me your dromedary .
This young girl is wounded , her life is in danger ...
The horses are exhausted .
They can 't go on in the sand .
Make your falcon attack the dromedary !
Where did the engaged couple go ?
Look at that !
Today he 's dressed as a farmer .

In spite of all the world 's philosophies , we do not know the Truth .
To know it , we must add the precision of mechanics to our imperfect senses .

Written and directed by N. M. Sobrevila
Cameraman :
A. Pou
While Kamus , deep in his workshop , elaborates his theories , life - happy for some , sad for others - follows its indifferent course .
Being wealthy only in optimism ,
Carlos was the only love and sole joy of Carmen .
Whereas Len ¨ ® , who never lacked for aught save happiness , was an incorrigible pessimist whose misery contaminated all those aroud him .
You 're embarrassing me , Luisa !
Stop jigging about like that poor creature .
They soon forget how to behave correctly .
I 'll wear it my whole life .
Why has Carlos so happy and Le ¨ ® n so miserable ?
Could Kamus answer this question ?
Carmen 's father suddenly started pondering the awful fact that he couldn 't afford to go to the bullfight .
Is that the patron saint of flying ?
And he had nothing to sell .
A ring is a link joining together two lives .
Wear it always and we 'll stay together for ever .
I won 't put up with this loose living any more .
You 're off having fun while I 'm working .
Daddy , I give you all I earn .
What more do you want ?
What about me ?
I gave you life !
Didn 't give you all you are ?
All you 're worth ?
Ciriaco 's daughter is a good-for-nothing , yet her father has plenty of money .
Is this ring worth anything ?
Go and see how much you can get for it .
If I go and sell it , I 'll be late for my rehearsal .
I 'll wait for you at the theatre .
At the theatre where Carmen works , they 're ready to rehearse .
Where 's Carmen ?
She 's not here yet .
Because of her , we can 't rehearse .
Carmen has arrived .
The rehearsal is over .
You were held up by someone , were you ?
Give us a smile .
I 've got the money .
Come on .
It 's not too late for the bullfight .
Everything will work out .
My poor girl !
How you 've suffered !
I should never have let you come here .
You 're never going back to the theatre .
I 'll work for both us .
Carlos and Le ¨ ® n still have a different view of life .
We 'll have another picnic tomorrow .
You always see life through rose-tinted spectacles .
And you 're always too gloomy .
Who 's right ?
We 'll never know the truth .
You should listen to his advice .
Go and see him .
Tell Carmen I can 't see her this afternoon .
Carlos , if you want to know the truth , come .
Kamus .
The tormented Le ¨ ® n followed Carlos ' advice and went to see Kamus , in order to find out the Truth .
With this mechanical eye we shall find out the truth .
It can see much deeper than we can .
Greater , smaller , faster , slower ...
People have perverted it by imposing their own viewpoint .
But I leave it to act for itself .
And it observes with mathematical precision .
You will see things differently .
With our sixth sense .
My assistant will be here soon .
Yesterday I snatched him from his mother .
An interesting case of the deformation of maternal love .
She wanted him to go on working in the bank .
She 's revealed herself to be a monster .
We 'll have a good laugh when his mother comes .
A simple optical illusion .
A symphony is black and white .
That 's the true Madrid , without any literary deformation .
Sixth Sense Part 4
This device is much more effective than literature at giving us the sense of being in summer .
It even feels refreshing !
I 've seen some incredible things .
Without them knowing .
We saw that in a theatre .
We were hidden under a chair .
Is that Carmen being given money ?
This is the scientific truth .
Now here comes the maternal monster .
That 's how I want this phenomenon to be perceived .
What 's going on ?
Here is the Truth .
hat which hurts .
I 'm the one who 'll do the hurting !
That afternoon Carmen had no idea how she was going to explain the business of the ring to Carlos .
And Carlos ?
He knows about yesterday and doesn 't want to see you again .
You 'd be better off forgetting about us .
Carlos , if you want to know the truth , come .
Kamus .
I 'm a member of the Scientific Research Society .
Do you like what I do ?
Those barbaric , stupid rituals don 't interest me .
It was he who told my fianc ¨ ¦ what I did with the ring .
What 's all this business about the ring ?
This is the laboratory of the Truth .
Next time , you should be more careful with the truth .
I was right .
Life is gloomy .
Carmen 's cheating on you .
Kamus has the proof .
It 's not too late .
The truth hurts .
The truth bothers everyone .
Look at the state I 'm in .
A man prefers his own lies to the truth of others .
Be brave .
It 's her father !
I told Carmen you didn 't want to see her .
A pessimist is worse than a crook .
You must be stupid to want to find the truth , and crazy to show it .
It 's all my fault about the ring .
I wanted to go to the bullfight .
We 'll put it down to force majeure .
In spite of all the world 's philosophies , we do not know the Truth .

HYAS AND STENORHYNCHA Marine Crustacea
Four centimetres long ... these spider crabs take their garb from their surroundings .
Each dresses to taste .
Seaweed on the tip of the nose is undoubtedly striking .
A ravishing ball gown ...
A simple sports outfit .
They are often difficult to distinguish from their environment .
The Stenorhynchus is graceful , with long legs and long claws .
A Stenorhynchus arrayed in seaweed .
The seaweed is attached to spines evenly distributed on the shell .
Here the Stenorhynchus melts into its natural surroundings .
Stenorhyncha arrayed in sponge .
Note the small mandibles .
The third pair of legs are for greeting .
The claws for confrontation ...
Enlarging the Stenorhynchus ... conjures a near relation with legs two metres long and a habitat in far-off seas .
The Hyas is clumsy , with short legs and , usually , large claws .
Seen from below , the creature is identifiable .
Hyas covered in seaweed .
But from above , it looks simply like a clump of seaweed out walking .
This one is more quietly dressed .
Vertical seaweed stripes , the latest fashion .
Hyas covered in sponges .
Going to grotesque lengths ...
He is taken into custody .
The mandibles remain visible .
Praying Buddha .
An invitation to the waltz , behind which lurk dark designs .
Like all crustacea ...
They are arm-wrestling enthusiasts .
They 're sometimes found in the vicinity of a worm the Spirograph , which inhabits a tube ... and extrudes or retracts , spirally , its respiratory plume .
The worm is 15 centimetres long , its plume 4 centimetres in diameter .
In the centre of the plume is the mouth .
Here we can see the branchia of the plume increasingly enlarged .
An extreme enlargement shows the vibratile cilia ... one thousandth of a millimetre long , covering the branchia .
They circulate the water , sending food particles to the worm 's mouth .
The Japanese warrior .
Hyas and Stenorhyncha sometimes nibble the Spirograph 's branchia .
A Stenorhynchus flees , rubbing its eye .
The caress of the Spirograph .
A Loie Fuller ballet .
Following a classical spiral retraction comes the firework display .
Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris
A Trip to the Moon by George Melies
The astronomers are assembled in a large hall embellished with instruments .
The president and members of the committee enter .
Everybody takes his seat .
Entrance of six man-servants carrying the telescopes of the astronomers .
The president takes his chair and explains to the members his plan for a trip to the moon .
The scheme is approved by many .
But one member violently opposes same .
After some argument , the president throws his papers and books at his head .
Upon order being restored , the trip proposed by the president is voted by acclimation .
The man-servants bring travelling suits .
President Barbenfouillis selects five colleagues to accompany him :
Nostradamus , Alcofrisbas , Omega , Micromegas and Parafaragamus .
We enter the interior of the workshop where smiths , mechanics , weighers , carpenters , upholsterers , et cetera are working hard at the completion of the machine .
Micromegas accidentally falls into a tub of nitric acid .
A workman informs the astronomers that if they would ascend to the roof , they will witness a splendid spectacle :
the casting of the gun .
Against the horizon , the chimneys are seen belching forth volumes of smoke .
Suddenly , the flag is hoisted .
At the signal , a mass of molten steel is directed from each furnace into the mold for the gun .
The mold pours forth flames and vapor .
On the top of the roofs of the town , pompous preparations have been made .
The shell is in position , ready to receive the travelers .
These arrive respond to the acclamations of the crowd ... ... and finally enter the shell .
A marine closes the bridge through which they have passed .
A number of gunners are pushing the shell up an incline into the mouth of the gun .
The cannon is loaded .
The bridge is closed .
Everyone is waiting for the signal which starts the shell on its voyage .
An officer gives the signal .
The gun is fired and the shell disappears into space .
The shell coming closer every minute , the moon magnifies rapidly until finally it attains colossal dimensions .
Suddenly , the shell pierces the eye of the moon .
The shell comes down with a crash .
The astronomers get out and are delighted at the landscape which is new to them .
Against the horizon , the Earth is rising slowly into space illuminating the picture with a fantastic light .
The astronomers see craters everywhere .
Just as they are about to explore , an explosion throws the unfortunate men violently in all directions .
The astronomers show signs of fatigue after the rough trip they have just had .
They stretch themselves out on the ground and go to sleep .
Seven gigantic stars representing the Great Bear appear slowly , and out of the stars come faces of women who seem annoyed at the presence of these intruders in the moon .
Then , the stars are replaced by a lovely vision of Phoebes on the crescent , of Saturn in his globe and of charming young girls holding up a star .
They decide to punish the terrestrials in an exemplary manner .
By order of Phoebes , snow is falling from all quarters , covering the ground with its white coat .
The cold becomes unbearable .
So the unfortunate voyagers wake up half-frozen .
They decide without hesitation and in spite of the danger to descend into the interior of the great crater in which they disappear one-by-one whilst the snowstorm is still raging .
The astronomers arrive into the interior of a most curious grotto filled with enormous mushrooms of every kind .
One of them opens his umbrella to compare its size with the mushroom , but the umbrella suddenly takes root and transforming itself into a mushroom starts growing attaining gigantic proportions .
The astronomers suddenly notice strange beings coming out from underneath the mushrooms while making singular contortions .
These are the Selenites , or inhabitants of the Moon .
A fantastical being rushes on an astronomer who defends himself and with a stroke of his umbrella the Selenite bursts into a thousand pieces .
But the Selenites are arriving in numbers .
The astronomers are captured , bound and taken to the palace of the King of the Selenites .
On a splendid throne , surrounded by living stars , the Selenite king is seated .
President Barbenfouillis makes a dash for the King of the Selenites and lifting him like a feather throws him violently on the ground .
The astronomers run away in the midst of the general disorder .
The Selenite army is pursuing them .
The astronomers run at full speed turning around each time they are pressed too closely and reducing the fragile beings to dust .
At last , the astronomers have found the shell and quickly shut themselves in the interior .
Thanks to the advance , they have succeeded in getting over their adversaries .
Only one , the president , has been left behind .
He rushes to the rope which hangs from the point of the shell and letting himself slide down the rope he gives it an impetus which causes the shell to fall off the edge of the moon .
The shell falls with sickening rapidity .
The sea appears .
The shell balances and thanks to the hermetically sealed air in its interior rises slowly to the surface .
The shell is picked up by a steamer which tows it to port .
The Mayor welcomes the astronomers with a speech , and the general ovation awaits their happy return .
